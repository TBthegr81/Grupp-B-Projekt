1
00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:50.992
<i>- Yeah.
-  Is everything in place?</i>

2
00:00:51,734 --> 00:00:53,577
<i>You weren't supposed to relieve me.</i>

3
00:00:53,731 --> 00:00:56,052
<i>I know, but I felt like taking a shift.</i>

4
00:00:56,801 --> 00:00:59,172
<i>You like him, don't you?
You like watching him.</i>

5
00:00:59,428 --> 00:01:02,429
<i>- Don't be ridiculous.
- We're gonna kill him. You understand that?</i>

6
00:01:02,682 --> 00:01:05,173
<i>Morpheus believes he is the One.</i>

7
00:01:05,435 --> 00:01:08,353
<i>- Do you?
- It doesn't matter what I believe.</i>

8
00:01:08,605 --> 00:01:10,230
<i>You don't, do you?</i>

9
00:01:10,482 --> 00:01:12,558
<i>- Did you hear that?
- Hear what?</i>

10
00:01:12,818 --> 00:01:14,395
<i>Are you sure this line is clean?</i>

11
00:01:14,652 --> 00:01:16,645
<i>Yeah, of course I'm sure.</i>

12
00:01:16,988 --> 00:01:18,347
<i>I better go.</i>

13
00:01:56,405 --> 00:01:58,197
- Freeze! Police!
- Hands on your head!

14
00:01:58,741 --> 00:02:00,520
Do it!
Do it now!

15
00:02:21,223 --> 00:02:22,551
Lieutenant.

16
00:02:22,725 --> 00:02:23,839
Oh, shit.

17
00:02:24,785 --> 00:02:27,889
Lieutenant, you were given specific orders.

18
00:02:28,147 --> 00:02:29,854
Hey, I'm just doing my job.

19
00:02:30,382 --> 00:02:35,095
You give me that "juris-my-dick-tion" crap,
you can cram it up your ass.

20
00:02:35,363 --> 00:02:37,854
The orders were for your protection.

21
00:02:39,467 --> 00:02:41,574
I think we are gonna handle one little girl.

22
00:02:46,708 --> 00:02:48,451
I sent two units!

23
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:50,288
They're bringing her down now!

24
00:02:50,545 --> 00:02:53,665
No, Lieutenant, your men are already dead.

25
00:03:23,096 --> 00:03:23,925
Shit.

26
00:03:26,459 --> 00:03:28,831
Morpheus, the line was traced.
I don't know how.

27
00:03:29,086 --> 00:03:30,664
<i>I know. They cut the hard line.</i>

28
00:03:30,922 --> 00:03:33,080
<i>There's no time. You are gonna have to get to another exit.</i>

29
00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:34,560
Are there any agents?

30
00:03:34,949 --> 00:03:35,849
<i>Yes.</i>

31
00:03:35,868 --> 00:03:37,131
Goddamn it.

32
00:03:37,386 --> 00:03:38,929
<i>You have to focus, Trinity.</i>

33
00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:41,553
<i>There's a phone at Wells and Lake.</i>

34
00:03:41,933 --> 00:03:43,593
<i>You can make it.</i>

35
00:03:43,852 --> 00:03:45,512
<i>- All right.
- Go.</i>

36
00:04:47,669 --> 00:04:48,700
That's impossible.

37
00:05:23,607 --> 00:05:25,747
Get up, Trinity.
Just get up.

38
00:05:26,376 --> 00:05:27,475
Get up.

39
00:06:13,468 --> 00:06:14,962
She got out.

40
00:06:15,262 --> 00:06:16,542
It doesn't matter.

41
00:06:16,805 --> 00:06:18,881
The informant is real.

42
00:06:19,382 --> 00:06:20,082
Yes.

43
00:06:20,224 --> 00:06:21,885
We have the name of their next target.

44
00:06:22,143 --> 00:06:23,803
The name is Neo.

45
00:06:27,007 --> 00:06:28,601
We'll need a search running.

46
00:06:29,201 --> 00:06:30,810
It has already begun.

47
00:07:25,585 --> 00:07:26,783
What?

48
00:07:32,551 --> 00:07:34,046
What the hell?

49
00:07:41,686 --> 00:07:43,643
"Follow the white rabbit."

50
00:07:55,492 --> 00:07:56,654
Who is it?

51
00:07:56,910 --> 00:07:58,191
It's Choi.

52
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:04,444
Yeah.

53
00:08:11,817 --> 00:08:12,880
You're two hours late.

54
00:08:13,469 --> 00:08:15,213
I know. It's her fault.

55
00:08:15,513 --> 00:08:17,553
You got the money?

56
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:19,763
Two grand.

57
00:08:20,644 --> 00:08:21,759
Hold on.

58
00:08:39,455 --> 00:08:40,830
Hallelujah.

59
00:08:41,081 --> 00:08:44,152
You're my savior, man.
My own personal Jesus Christ.

60
00:08:44,210 --> 00:08:46,084
You get caught using that...

61
00:08:46,137 --> 00:08:48,461
Yeah. I know. This never happened.
You don't exist.

62
00:08:49,591 --> 00:08:51,667
- Right.
- Something wrong, man?

63
00:08:51,927 --> 00:08:53,966
You look a little whiter than usual.

64
00:08:55,096 --> 00:08:57,255
My computer, it...

65
00:09:00,269 --> 00:09:05,312
Ever have that feeling where you're not
sure if you're awake or still dreaming?

66
00:09:05,608 --> 00:09:08,360
All the time.
It's called mescaline.

67
00:09:08,861 --> 00:09:10,984
It's the only way to fly.

68
00:09:11,264 --> 00:09:14,355
Hey, it just sounds to me like you need to unplug, man.

69
00:09:15,018 --> 00:09:17,157
You know, get some R and R?

70
00:09:17,537 --> 00:09:19,125
What do you think, Dujour?

71
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:20,900
Should we take him with us?

72
00:09:23,193 --> 00:09:24,491
Definitely.

73
00:09:24,711 --> 00:09:27,878
No, I can't. I have work tomorrow.

74
00:09:28,423 --> 00:09:29,538
Come on.

75
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:32,421
It'll be fun. I promise.

76
00:09:38,835 --> 00:09:40,128
Yeah.

77
00:09:41,270 --> 00:09:43,144
Sure. I'll go.

78
00:10:10,767 --> 00:10:11,796
Hello, Neo.

79
00:10:13,345 --> 00:10:16,845
- How do you know that name?
- I know a lot about you.

80
00:10:17,925 --> 00:10:20,102
- Who are you?
- My name is Trinity.

81
00:10:20,770 --> 00:10:21,969
Trinity.

82
00:10:23,974 --> 00:10:26,940
The Trinity?
That cracked the IRS D-base?

83
00:10:27,193 --> 00:10:28,652
That was a long time ago.

84
00:10:28,903 --> 00:10:30,813
- Jesus.
- What?

85
00:10:31,281 --> 00:10:33,073
I just thought...

86
00:10:34,827 --> 00:10:35,990
you were a guy.

87
00:10:36,245 --> 00:10:37,704
Most guys do.

88
00:10:38,915 --> 00:10:41,120
That was you on my computer.

89
00:10:41,950 --> 00:10:42,865
How did you do that?

90
00:10:43,502 --> 00:10:46,207
Right now, all I can tell you...

91
00:10:46,939 --> 00:10:48,382
is that you're in danger.

92
00:10:48,841 --> 00:10:51,249
- I brought you here to warn you.
- Of what?

93
00:10:51,845 --> 00:10:53,505
They're watching you, Neo.

94
00:10:54,097 --> 00:10:56,504
- Who is?
- Please just listen.

95
00:11:00,220 --> 00:11:01,847
I know why you're here, Neo.

96
00:11:02,648 --> 00:11:04,605
I know what you've been doing.

97
00:11:04,858 --> 00:11:06,732
I know why you hardly sleep...

98
00:11:07,027 --> 00:11:10,148
why you live alone and why, night after night...

99
00:11:10,406 --> 00:11:12,731
you sit at your computer.

100
00:11:13,909 --> 00:11:15,452
You're looking for him.

101
00:11:16,445 --> 00:11:19,246
I know, because I was once looking for the same thing.

102
00:11:19,749 --> 00:11:21,872
And when he found me...

103
00:11:22,402 --> 00:11:25,587
he told me I wasn't really looking for him...

104
00:11:26,507 --> 00:11:28,249
I was looking for an answer.

105
00:11:28,883 --> 00:11:32,003
It's the question that drives us, Neo.

106
00:11:32,679 --> 00:11:35,349
It's the question that brought you here.

107
00:11:37,435 --> 00:11:38,810
You know the question...

108
00:11:39,061 --> 00:11:40,556
just as I did.

109
00:11:42,105 --> 00:11:43,730
What is the Matrix?

110
00:11:43,983 --> 00:11:46,438
The answer is out there, Neo.

111
00:11:47,111 --> 00:11:49,104
It's looking for you.

112
00:11:50,006 --> 00:11:51,614
And it will find you...

113
00:11:51,866 --> 00:11:53,859
if you want it to.

114
00:12:00,267 --> 00:12:01,298
Oh, shit.

115
00:12:01,677 --> 00:12:02,991
Oh. Shit, shit.

116
00:12:13,263 --> 00:12:16,099
You have a problem with authority, Mr. Anderson.

117
00:12:16,350 --> 00:12:20,395
You believe that you are special, that
somehow the rules do not apply to you.

118
00:12:21,005 --> 00:12:23,098
Obviously, you are mistaken.

119
00:12:26,069 --> 00:12:28,939
This company is one of the top software
companies in the world...

120
00:12:29,197 --> 00:12:32,566
because every single employee understands
they are part of a whole.

121
00:12:32,826 --> 00:12:37,453
Thus, if an employee has a problem,
the company has a problem.

122
00:12:39,709 --> 00:12:42,912
The time has come to make a choice, Mr. Anderson.

123
00:12:43,795 --> 00:12:47,663
Either you choose to be at your desk
on time from this day forth...

124
00:12:48,401 --> 00:12:50,874
or you choose to find yourself another job.

125
00:12:51,763 --> 00:12:53,091
Do I make myself clear?

126
00:12:53,348 --> 00:12:55,756
Yes, Mr. Rhineheart.
Perfectly clear.

127
00:13:04,234 --> 00:13:06,227
Thomas Anderson?

128
00:13:07,363 --> 00:13:08,773
Yeah, that's me.

129
00:13:16,689 --> 00:13:17,751
Great.

130
00:13:19,375 --> 00:13:20,538
Have a nice day.

131
00:13:36,380 --> 00:13:37,266
Hello.

132
00:13:37,352 --> 00:13:40,686
<i>Hello, Neo. Do you know who this is?</i>

133
00:13:42,942 --> 00:13:44,686
<i>- Morpheus.
- Yes.</i>

134
00:13:44,943 --> 00:13:46,936
<i>I've been looking for you, Neo.</i>

135
00:13:47,196 --> 00:13:50,363
<i>I don't know if you're ready to see
what I want to show you.</i>

136
00:13:50,616 --> 00:13:53,783
<i>But unfortunately, you and I have run out of time.</i>

137
00:13:54,037 --> 00:13:57,738
<i>They're coming for you Neo, and I don't
know what they're going to do.</i>

138
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,328
Who's coming for me?

139
00:13:59,585 --> 00:14:01,660
<i>Stand up and see for yourself.</i>

140
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:04,707
<i>- What? Right now?
- Yes.</i>

141
00:14:04,965 --> 00:14:06,210
<i>Now.</i>

142
00:14:07,092 --> 00:14:08,966
<i>Do it slowly.</i>

143
00:14:09,386 --> 00:14:10,585
<i>The elevator.</i>

144
00:14:15,475 --> 00:14:17,267
<i>- Oh, shit!
- Yes.</i>

145
00:14:21,941 --> 00:14:23,056
What the hell they want from me?

146
00:14:23,234 --> 00:14:26,650
<i>I don't know. but If you don't wanna find out,
I suggest you get out of there.</i>

147
00:14:27,221 --> 00:14:27,753
How?

148
00:14:27,831 --> 00:14:31,115
<i>I can guide you, but you must do exactly as I say.</i>

149
00:14:31,316 --> 00:14:32,016
Okey.

150
00:14:31,993 --> 00:14:33,986
<i>The cubicle across from you is empty.</i>

151
00:14:37,124 --> 00:14:39,247
<i>- But what if they...
- Go. Now.</i>

152
00:14:46,009 --> 00:14:48,380
<i>Stay here for just a moment.</i>

153
00:14:55,802 --> 00:15:00,562
<i>When I tell you, go to the end of the row
to the office at the end of the hall.</i>

154
00:15:00,816 --> 00:15:03,187
<i>Stay as low as you can.</i>

155
00:15:05,670 --> 00:15:06,602
<i>Go. Now.</i>

156
00:15:21,003 --> 00:15:24,538
<i>Good. Now, outside there is a scaffold.</i>

157
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:29,586
<i>- How do you know all this?
- We don't have time Neo.</i>

158
00:15:29,846 --> 00:15:32,681
<i>To your left there's a window. Go to it.</i>

159
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,477
<i>Open it.</i>

160
00:15:37,312 --> 00:15:39,104
<i>Take the scaffold to the roof.</i>

161
00:15:39,356 --> 00:15:41,930
No way! No way!
This is crazy!

162
00:15:42,193 --> 00:15:44,565
<i>There are two ways out of this building.</i>

163
00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:48,604
<i>One is that scaffold. The other is in their custody.</i>

164
00:15:48,866 --> 00:15:52,069
<i>You take a chance either way. I leave it to you.</i>

165
00:15:55,665 --> 00:15:57,409
This is insane!

166
00:15:58,785 --> 00:16:00,459
Why is this happening to me?

167
00:16:00,754 --> 00:16:02,379
What'd I do?

168
00:16:02,756 --> 00:16:05,507
I'm nobody.
I didn't do anything.

169
00:16:06,192 --> 00:16:07,551
I'm gonna die.

170
00:16:17,355 --> 00:16:18,385
Shit!

171
00:16:38,668 --> 00:16:39,783
Oh, shit!

172
00:16:44,759 --> 00:16:46,550
I can't do this.

173
00:16:59,349 --> 00:17:00,228
Shit.

174
00:17:49,494 --> 00:17:55,021
As you can see, we've had our eye on you
for some time now, Mr. Anderson.

175
00:17:55,625 --> 00:17:58,294
It seems that you've been living...

176
00:17:58,544 --> 00:18:00,668
two lives.

177
00:18:02,090 --> 00:18:08,273
In one life, you're Thomas A. Anderson program
writer for a respectable software company.

178
00:18:09,222 --> 00:18:12,508
You have a social security number.
You pay your taxes.

179
00:18:12,976 --> 00:18:14,221
And you...

180
00:18:15,813 --> 00:18:19,631
help your landlady carry out her garbage.

181
00:18:21,944 --> 00:18:25,064
The other life is lived in computers...

182
00:18:25,264 --> 00:18:33,590
where you go by the hacker alias "Neo" and are guilty of
virtually every computer crime we have a law for.

183
00:18:34,666 --> 00:18:36,623
One of these lives...

184
00:18:36,876 --> 00:18:38,703
has a future.

185
00:18:39,045 --> 00:18:41,038
And one of them does not.

186
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:49,592
I'm going to be as forthcoming as I can be, Mr. Anderson.

187
00:18:49,599 --> 00:18:53,500
You're here because we need your help.

188
00:18:57,148 --> 00:19:00,149
We know that you've been contacted by a certain...

189
00:19:00,301 --> 00:19:02,193
individual.

190
00:19:03,113 --> 00:19:07,157
A man who calls himself "Morpheus."

191
00:19:08,159 --> 00:19:12,157
Whatever you think you know about this man is irrelevant.

192
00:19:12,214 --> 00:19:18,120
He is considered by many authorities
to be the most dangerous man alive.

193
00:19:20,882 --> 00:19:22,080
My colleagues...

194
00:19:22,507 --> 00:19:25,425
believe that I am wasting my time with you.

195
00:19:25,719 --> 00:19:29,136
But I believe you wish to do the right thing.

196
00:19:29,432 --> 00:19:32,932
We're willing to wipe the slate clean...

197
00:19:33,311 --> 00:19:35,434
give you a fresh start.

198
00:19:35,939 --> 00:19:42,608
Now, all we're asking in return is your cooperation
in bringing a known terrorist to justice.

199
00:19:43,989 --> 00:19:45,234
Yeah.

200
00:19:46,533 --> 00:19:48,610
Well, that sounds like a really good deal.

201
00:19:50,246 --> 00:19:51,789
But I think I got a better one.

202
00:19:52,048 --> 00:19:53,741
How about...

203
00:19:54,166 --> 00:19:56,159
I give you the finger...

204
00:19:58,754 --> 00:20:00,794
and you give me my phone call.

205
00:20:02,967 --> 00:20:04,794
Mr. Anderson...

206
00:20:09,165 --> 00:20:10,010
you disappoint me.

207
00:20:10,266 --> 00:20:12,888
You can't scare me with this gestapo crap.

208
00:20:13,145 --> 00:20:14,520
I know my rights.

209
00:20:14,771 --> 00:20:16,266
I want my phone call.

210
00:20:16,857 --> 00:20:19,016
Tell me, Mr. Anderson...

211
00:20:19,902 --> 00:20:25,211
what good is a phone call if you're unable to speak?

212
00:20:58,943 --> 00:21:01,149
You're going to help us, Mr. Anderson...

213
00:21:01,863 --> 00:21:03,939
whether you want to or not.

214
00:22:02,260 --> 00:22:05,510
<i>This line is tapped, so I must be brief.</i>

215
00:22:05,764 --> 00:22:10,058
<i>They got to you first, but they've
underestimated how important you are.</i>

216
00:22:10,210 --> 00:22:12,136
<i>If they knew what I know...</i>

217
00:22:12,395 --> 00:22:14,388
<i>you would probably be dead.</i>

218
00:22:15,398 --> 00:22:19,099
What are you talking about?
What... What is happening to me?

219
00:22:19,361 --> 00:22:21,977
<i>You are the One, Neo.</i>

220
00:22:22,478 --> 00:22:27,489
<i> You see you may have spent the last few years
looking for me, but I've spent my entire life...</i>

221
00:22:27,561 --> 00:22:29,155
<i>looking for you.</i>

222
00:22:30,706 --> 00:22:32,865
<i>Now, do you still want to meet?</i>

223
00:22:33,835 --> 00:22:36,706
<i>- Yes.
- Then go to the Adams Street bridge.</i>

224
00:22:46,932 --> 00:22:48,130
Get in.

225
00:23:00,404 --> 00:23:04,023
- What the hell is this?
- It's necessary, Neo. For our protection.

226
00:23:04,283 --> 00:23:06,442
- From what?
- From you.

227
00:23:07,896 --> 00:23:09,655
- Take off your shirt.
- What.

228
00:23:10,190 --> 00:23:11,747
Stop the car.

229
00:23:15,178 --> 00:23:16,541
Listen to me, coppertop.

230
00:23:16,796 --> 00:23:19,289
We don't have time for 20 Questions.

231
00:23:19,299 --> 00:23:21,672
Right now, there's only one rule:

232
00:23:21,969 --> 00:23:23,297
Our way...

233
00:23:23,537 --> 00:23:24,717
or the highway.

234
00:23:31,528 --> 00:23:32,343
Fine.

235
00:23:34,232 --> 00:23:36,687
Please, Neo, you have to trust me.

236
00:23:37,277 --> 00:23:39,898
- Why?
- Because you have been down there, Neo.

237
00:23:40,655 --> 00:23:41,854
You know that road.

238
00:23:42,866 --> 00:23:44,725
You know exactly where it ends.

239
00:23:46,703 --> 00:23:49,245
And I know that's not where you wanna be.

240
00:24:03,137 --> 00:24:04,679
Apoc, lights.

241
00:24:07,183 --> 00:24:09,342
Lie back.
Lift up your shirt.

242
00:24:11,471 --> 00:24:13,713
- What's that thing?
- We think you're bugged.

243
00:24:21,281 --> 00:24:22,740
Try and relax.

244
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:30,202
Come on.

245
00:24:31,317 --> 00:24:33,456
Come on.

246
00:24:34,086 --> 00:24:35,626
It's on the move.

247
00:24:36,839 --> 00:24:38,038
Come on, you shit.

248
00:24:39,784 --> 00:24:41,961
- You're gonna lose it.
- No, I'm not.

249
00:24:42,337 --> 00:24:43,382
Clear!

250
00:24:51,980 --> 00:24:54,104
Jesus Christ!
That thing is real.

251
00:25:27,752 --> 00:25:29,180
This is it.

252
00:25:32,523 --> 00:25:34,979
Let me give you one piece of advice.

253
00:25:35,943 --> 00:25:37,603
Be honest.

254
00:25:39,197 --> 00:25:41,403
He knows more than you can imagine.

255
00:25:50,125 --> 00:25:51,453
At last.

256
00:25:53,003 --> 00:25:54,082
Welcome, Neo.

257
00:25:55,297 --> 00:25:57,207
As you no doubt have guessed...

258
00:25:57,466 --> 00:25:58,711
I am Morpheus.

259
00:25:59,761 --> 00:26:01,337
It's an honor to meet you.

260
00:26:01,803 --> 00:26:02,835
No...

261
00:26:03,430 --> 00:26:04,711
the honor is mine.

262
00:26:05,641 --> 00:26:08,132
Please, come. Sit.

263
00:26:23,243 --> 00:26:24,868
I imagine...

264
00:26:25,287 --> 00:26:28,039
that right now you're feeling a bit like Alice...

265
00:26:29,750 --> 00:26:32,157
tumbling down the rabbit hole?

266
00:26:33,187 --> 00:26:34,830
You could say that.

267
00:26:35,005 --> 00:26:37,627
I can see it in your eyes.

268
00:26:38,217 --> 00:26:41,203
You have the look of a man who accepts what he sees...

269
00:26:41,363 --> 00:26:44,005
because he's expecting to wake up.

270
00:26:45,434 --> 00:26:48,054
Ironically, this is not far from the truth.

271
00:26:48,728 --> 00:26:51,219
Do you believe in fate, Neo?

272
00:26:51,723 --> 00:26:53,812
- No.
- Why not?

273
00:26:54,067 --> 00:26:56,855
Because I don't like the idea that I'm not in control of my life.

274
00:26:57,847 --> 00:27:01,281
I know exactly what you mean.

275
00:27:05,579 --> 00:27:07,852
Let me tell you why you're here.

276
00:27:08,900 --> 00:27:10,542
You're here because you know something.

277
00:27:11,085 --> 00:27:12,710
What you know, you can't explain.

278
00:27:13,213 --> 00:27:14,791
But you feel it.

279
00:27:15,382 --> 00:27:17,491
You felt it your entire life.

280
00:27:17,885 --> 00:27:22,048
Is there something's wrong with the world.
You don't know what it is, but it's there.

281
00:27:22,456 --> 00:27:24,762
Like a splinter in your mind...

282
00:27:25,017 --> 00:27:26,891
driving you mad.

283
00:27:27,611 --> 00:27:30,563
It is this feeling that has brought you to me.

284
00:27:33,009 --> 00:27:34,935
Do you know what I'm talking about?

285
00:27:36,679 --> 00:27:38,107
The Matrix?

286
00:27:40,516 --> 00:27:42,277
Do you want to know...

287
00:27:42,544 --> 00:27:44,237
what it is?

288
00:27:47,124 --> 00:27:48,997
The Matrix is everywhere.

289
00:27:49,250 --> 00:27:50,958
It is all around us.

290
00:27:51,111 --> 00:27:53,168
Even now, in this very room.

291
00:27:53,905 --> 00:27:56,212
You can see it when you look out your window...

292
00:27:56,467 --> 00:27:58,792
or when you turn on your television.

293
00:27:59,220 --> 00:28:01,758
You can feel it when you go to work...

294
00:28:03,208 --> 00:28:04,967
when you go to church...

295
00:28:05,392 --> 00:28:07,468
when you pay your taxes.

296
00:28:08,404 --> 00:28:13,461
It is the world that has been pulled over
your eyes to blind you from the truth.

297
00:28:15,570 --> 00:28:16,815
What truth?

298
00:28:21,075 --> 00:28:23,518
That you are a slave, Neo.

299
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:26,410
Like everyone else, you were born into bondage...

300
00:28:26,665 --> 00:28:31,328
born into a prison that you cannot smell or taste or touch.

301
00:28:31,629 --> 00:28:32,909
A prison...

302
00:28:33,172 --> 00:28:34,635
for your mind.

303
00:28:41,305 --> 00:28:43,631
Unfortunately, no one can be...

304
00:28:43,975 --> 00:28:46,347
told what the Matrix is.

305
00:28:49,815 --> 00:28:51,688
You have to see it for yourself.

306
00:29:01,202 --> 00:29:03,491
This is your last chance.

307
00:29:03,746 --> 00:29:06,071
After this, there is no turning back.

308
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:08,034
You take the blue pill...

309
00:29:08,234 --> 00:29:13,421
the story ends, you wake up in your bed and
believe whatever you want to believe.

310
00:29:13,573 --> 00:29:15,002
You take the red pill...

311
00:29:15,158 --> 00:29:17,215
you stay in Wonderland...

312
00:29:17,719 --> 00:29:20,424
and I show you how deep the rabbit hole goes.

313
00:29:30,316 --> 00:29:31,514
Remember...

314
00:29:32,360 --> 00:29:35,396
all I'm offering is the truth.
Nothing more.

315
00:29:49,711 --> 00:29:51,040
Follow me.

316
00:29:53,490 --> 00:29:55,250
Apoc, are we on-line?

317
00:29:55,508 --> 00:29:56,884
Almost.

318
00:30:00,122 --> 00:30:02,262
Time is always against us.

319
00:30:02,541 --> 00:30:04,136
Please take a seat there.

320
00:30:22,328 --> 00:30:24,036
You did all this?

321
00:30:28,168 --> 00:30:30,161
The pill you took is part of a trace program.

322
00:30:30,921 --> 00:30:35,548
It's designed to disrupts your Input-Output carrier
signals, so we can pinpoint your location.

323
00:30:36,094 --> 00:30:37,125
What does that mean?

324
00:30:37,719 --> 00:30:39,878
It means buckle your seat belt, Dorothy...

325
00:30:40,222 --> 00:30:41,551
because Kansas...

326
00:30:41,807 --> 00:30:42,839
is going bye-bye.

327
00:31:20,766 --> 00:31:22,141
Did you...

328
00:31:33,053 --> 00:31:37,234
Have you ever had a dream, Neo,
that you were so sure was real?

329
00:31:38,701 --> 00:31:41,274
What if you were unable to wake from that dream?

330
00:31:41,537 --> 00:31:44,028
How would you know the difference
between the dream world...

331
00:31:44,665 --> 00:31:46,076
and the real world?

332
00:31:47,710 --> 00:31:50,083
- This can't be.
- Be what?

333
00:31:50,897 --> 00:31:52,292
Be real?

334
00:31:56,161 --> 00:31:57,641
- It's going into replication.
- Apoc.

335
00:31:58,013 --> 00:32:00,682
- Still nothing.
- It's cold.

336
00:32:00,933 --> 00:32:02,308
It's cold!

337
00:32:06,188 --> 00:32:07,949
Tank, we are going to need a signal soon.

338
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:11,921
- I got a fibrillation.
- Apoc, location.

339
00:32:11,978 --> 00:32:13,736
Targeting almost there.

340
00:32:16,833 --> 00:32:18,423
He's going into arrest.

341
00:32:18,701 --> 00:32:21,093
- Lock. I got him!
- Now, Tank, now!

342
00:35:18,474 --> 00:35:19,553
Welcome...

343
00:35:19,892 --> 00:35:21,802
to the real world.

344
00:35:23,229 --> 00:35:25,056
We've done it, Trinity.

345
00:35:25,315 --> 00:35:26,857
We found him.

346
00:35:27,109 --> 00:35:29,895
- I hope you're right.
- I don't have to hope.

347
00:35:30,486 --> 00:35:32,064
I know it.

348
00:35:37,244 --> 00:35:38,275
Am I dead?

349
00:35:38,787 --> 00:35:40,946
Far from it.

350
00:35:54,829 --> 00:35:56,340
He still needs a lot of work.

351
00:35:57,891 --> 00:35:58,970
What are you doing?

352
00:35:59,026 --> 00:36:01,432
Your muscles have atrophied.
We're rebuilding them.

353
00:36:02,020 --> 00:36:03,562
Why do my eyes hurt?

354
00:36:04,272 --> 00:36:06,146
You've never used them before.

355
00:36:10,112 --> 00:36:12,364
Rest, Neo. The answers are coming.

356
00:37:27,344 --> 00:37:29,022
Morpheus, what's happened to me?

357
00:37:29,980 --> 00:37:33,647
- What is this place?
- More important than "what" is "when."

358
00:37:34,367 --> 00:37:37,452
- When?
- You believe it's the year 1999...

359
00:37:37,704 --> 00:37:39,946
when in fact, it's closer to 2199.

360
00:37:41,083 --> 00:37:45,711
I can't tell you exactly what year it is
because we honestly don't know.

361
00:37:46,114 --> 00:37:49,048
There's nothing I can say that will explain it for you, Neo.

362
00:37:49,300 --> 00:37:50,462
Come with me.

363
00:37:50,660 --> 00:37:52,040
And see for yourself.

364
00:37:52,595 --> 00:37:54,339
This is my ship.

365
00:37:54,639 --> 00:37:57,557
The Nebuchadnezzar.
It's a hovercraft.

366
00:38:00,395 --> 00:38:02,139
This is the main deck.

367
00:38:08,286 --> 00:38:09,149
This is the core...

368
00:38:11,457 --> 00:38:15,406
where we broadcast our pirate signal and hack into the Matrix.

369
00:38:18,789 --> 00:38:21,956
Most of my crew you already know.

370
00:38:26,965 --> 00:38:28,376
This is Apoc...

371
00:38:29,176 --> 00:38:30,504
Switch...

372
00:38:32,095 --> 00:38:33,257
- and Cypher.
- Hi.

373
00:38:33,513 --> 00:38:37,214
The ones you don't know:
Tank and his big brother, Dozer.

374
00:38:38,001 --> 00:38:40,509
The little one behind you is Mouse.

375
00:38:44,859 --> 00:38:48,609
You wanted to know what the Matrix is, Neo?

376
00:38:49,154 --> 00:38:50,352
Trinity.

377
00:39:11,386 --> 00:39:12,964
Try to relax.

378
00:39:17,852 --> 00:39:19,678
This will feel a little weird.

379
00:39:31,658 --> 00:39:32,821
This...

380
00:39:33,102 --> 00:39:34,909
is the Construct.

381
00:39:35,328 --> 00:39:37,451
It's our loading program.

382
00:39:37,506 --> 00:39:40,161
We can load anything, from clothing...

383
00:39:40,417 --> 00:39:41,792
to equipment...

384
00:39:41,985 --> 00:39:43,414
weapons...

385
00:39:44,046 --> 00:39:45,873
training simulations...

386
00:39:46,257 --> 00:39:48,795
anything we need.

387
00:39:51,595 --> 00:39:54,003
Right now we're inside a computer program?

388
00:39:54,106 --> 00:39:56,216
Is it really so hard to believe?

389
00:39:56,626 --> 00:39:59,748
Your clothes are different.
The plugs in your arms and head are gone.

390
00:40:00,563 --> 00:40:02,640
Your hair has changed.

391
00:40:03,025 --> 00:40:06,358
Your appearance now is what we call "residual self-image."

392
00:40:07,070 --> 00:40:10,191
It is the mental projection of your digital self.

393
00:40:13,003 --> 00:40:14,192
This...

394
00:40:15,579 --> 00:40:16,694
This isn't real?

395
00:40:16,956 --> 00:40:18,498
What is "real"?

396
00:40:18,863 --> 00:40:21,116
How do you define "real"?

397
00:40:21,418 --> 00:40:23,328
If you're talking about what you can feel...

398
00:40:23,487 --> 00:40:25,995
what you can smell, what you can taste and see...

399
00:40:26,257 --> 00:40:30,125
then "real" is simply electrical signals
interpreted by your brain.

400
00:40:34,308 --> 00:40:36,714
This is the world that you know.

401
00:40:38,144 --> 00:40:41,181
The world as it was at the end of the 20th century.

402
00:40:43,567 --> 00:40:47,897
It exists now only as part of a neural-interactive simulation...

403
00:40:48,155 --> 00:40:49,401
that we call the Matrix.

404
00:40:53,953 --> 00:40:56,788
You've been living in a dream world, Neo.

405
00:40:57,548 --> 00:40:58,863
This is the world...

406
00:40:59,167 --> 00:41:00,958
as it exists today.

407
00:41:13,974 --> 00:41:16,928
Welcome to "the desert...

408
00:41:17,712 --> 00:41:19,389
of the real."

409
00:41:22,775 --> 00:41:25,147
We have only bits and pieces of information.

410
00:41:25,302 --> 00:41:29,187
But what we know for certain is that at
some point in the early 21st century...

411
00:41:29,449 --> 00:41:32,699
all of mankind was united in celebration.

412
00:41:32,953 --> 00:41:38,398
We marveled at our own magnificence as we gave birth to AI.

413
00:41:38,499 --> 00:41:39,614
"AI"?

414
00:41:40,669 --> 00:41:42,044
You mean artificial intelligence.

415
00:41:42,095 --> 00:41:46,709
A singular consciousness that spawned
an entire race of machines.

416
00:41:47,551 --> 00:41:51,003
We don't know who struck first, us or them.

417
00:41:51,331 --> 00:41:54,633
But we know that it was us that scorched the sky.

418
00:41:56,310 --> 00:42:02,063
At the time they were dependent on solar power and it
was believed that they would be unable to survive...

419
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:05,900
without an energy sources as abundant as the sun.

420
00:42:06,154 --> 00:42:11,030
Throughout human history, we have been
dependent on machines to survive.

421
00:42:12,494 --> 00:42:16,706
Fate, it seems, is not without a sense of irony.

422
00:42:19,819 --> 00:42:24,331
The human body generates more
bioelectricity than a 120-volt battery.

423
00:42:24,590 --> 00:42:28,718
And over 25,000 BTUs of body heat.

424
00:42:30,638 --> 00:42:32,797
Combined with a form of fusion...

425
00:42:33,141 --> 00:42:37,969
the machines had found all the energy they would ever need.

426
00:42:42,025 --> 00:42:45,774
There are fields, Neo. Endless fields...

427
00:42:46,029 --> 00:42:49,280
where human beings are no longer born.

428
00:42:49,992 --> 00:42:51,819
We are grown.

429
00:42:57,875 --> 00:43:00,449
For the longest time, I wouldn't believe it.

430
00:43:00,611 --> 00:43:03,381
And then I saw the fields with my own eyes...

431
00:43:04,716 --> 00:43:09,930
watched them liquefy the dead so they could
be fed intravenously to the living.

432
00:43:10,471 --> 00:43:14,719
And standing there, facing the pure, horrifying precision...

433
00:43:14,876 --> 00:43:17,894
I came to realize the obviousness of the truth.

434
00:43:20,524 --> 00:43:22,316
What is the Matrix?

435
00:43:23,528 --> 00:43:24,558
Control.

436
00:43:25,946 --> 00:43:29,315
The Matrix is a computer-generated dream world...

437
00:43:30,017 --> 00:43:33,202
built to keep us under control...

438
00:43:34,372 --> 00:43:37,539
in order to change a human being...

439
00:43:38,168 --> 00:43:39,331
into this.

440
00:43:40,712 --> 00:43:41,826
No.

441
00:43:43,365 --> 00:43:45,042
I don't believe it.

442
00:43:45,425 --> 00:43:46,623
It's not possible.

443
00:43:47,219 --> 00:43:49,451
I didn't say it would be easy, Neo.

444
00:43:50,700 --> 00:43:51,799
I just said it would be the truth.

445
00:43:52,058 --> 00:43:53,635
Stop!

446
00:43:53,893 --> 00:43:55,091
Let me out!

447
00:43:55,811 --> 00:43:57,720
Let me out! I want out!

448
00:43:59,590 --> 00:44:02,360
- Easy, Neo. Easy.
- Get this thing out of me.

449
00:44:02,610 --> 00:44:04,270
Get this thing out of me!

450
00:44:06,072 --> 00:44:07,567
Don't touch me!
Stay away from me!

451
00:44:07,824 --> 00:44:09,449
Stay away from me!

452
00:44:09,868 --> 00:44:11,362
I don't believe it.

453
00:44:12,078 --> 00:44:13,276
I don't believe it.

454
00:44:13,538 --> 00:44:14,816
I don't believe it.

455
00:44:14,790 --> 00:44:18,790
- He's gonna pop.
- Breathe, Neo. Just breathe.

456
00:44:37,188 --> 00:44:38,980
I can't go back, can I?

457
00:44:39,566 --> 00:44:40,895
No.

458
00:44:41,968 --> 00:44:43,266
But if you could...

459
00:44:44,012 --> 00:44:45,606
would you really want to?

460
00:44:48,116 --> 00:44:49,527
I feel I owe you an apology.

461
00:44:49,977 --> 00:44:51,452
We have a rule.

462
00:44:51,812 --> 00:44:55,282
We never free a mind once it's reached a certain age.

463
00:44:55,441 --> 00:44:58,826
It's dangerous.
The mind has trouble letting go.

464
00:44:59,086 --> 00:45:01,375
I've seen it before, and I'm sorry.

465
00:45:02,423 --> 00:45:04,499
I did what I did because...

466
00:45:05,218 --> 00:45:06,677
I had to.

467
00:45:15,103 --> 00:45:19,184
When the Matrix was first built, there was a man born inside...

468
00:45:19,591 --> 00:45:23,476
who had the ability to change whatever he wanted...

469
00:45:23,863 --> 00:45:26,781
to remake the Matrix as he saw fit.

470
00:45:28,434 --> 00:45:31,985
It was he who freed the first of us...

471
00:45:32,872 --> 00:45:34,497
taught us the truth.

472
00:45:35,959 --> 00:45:39,043
As long as the Matrix exists...

473
00:45:39,279 --> 00:45:41,455
the human race will never be free.

474
00:45:45,577 --> 00:45:47,219
After he died...

475
00:45:47,971 --> 00:45:50,676
the Oracle prophesied his return...

476
00:45:51,225 --> 00:45:54,428
and that his coming would hail the destruction of the Matrix...

477
00:45:54,687 --> 00:45:56,347
end the war...

478
00:45:56,689 --> 00:45:58,587
bring freedom to our people.

479
00:45:59,174 --> 00:46:03,901
That is why there are those of us who has spent
our entire lives searching the Matrix...

480
00:46:04,238 --> 00:46:05,816
looking for him.

481
00:46:08,143 --> 00:46:10,319
I did what I did because...

482
00:46:11,955 --> 00:46:14,077
I believe that search is over.

483
00:46:19,171 --> 00:46:20,582
Get some rest.

484
00:46:21,215 --> 00:46:23,006
You're going to need it.

485
00:46:25,961 --> 00:46:27,419
For what?

486
00:46:30,110 --> 00:46:31,011
Your training.

487
00:46:49,127 --> 00:46:51,036
Morning. Did you sleep?

488
00:46:51,914 --> 00:46:53,112
You will tonight.

489
00:46:53,499 --> 00:46:55,041
I guarantee it.

490
00:46:56,544 --> 00:46:58,453
I'm Tank. I'll be your operator.

491
00:46:58,921 --> 00:47:01,528
- You don't have any...
- Holes? Nope.

492
00:47:02,258 --> 00:47:06,967
Me and my brother, Dozer, we are both 100% pure,
old-fashioned, homegrown human.

493
00:47:07,221 --> 00:47:08,420
Born free right here...

494
00:47:08,973 --> 00:47:10,302
in the real world.

495
00:47:10,559 --> 00:47:12,419
Genuine child of Zion.

496
00:47:13,061 --> 00:47:15,516
- Zion?
- If the war was over tomorrow...

497
00:47:15,772 --> 00:47:17,483
Zion's where the party would be.

498
00:47:17,691 --> 00:47:18,971
It's a city?

499
00:47:19,034 --> 00:47:23,001
The last human city.
The only place we have left.

500
00:47:23,789 --> 00:47:25,234
Where is it?

501
00:47:26,817 --> 00:47:27,993
Deep underground...

502
00:47:28,244 --> 00:47:30,802
near the Earth's core, where it's still warm.

503
00:47:32,039 --> 00:47:34,313
You live long enough, you might even see it.

504
00:47:36,169 --> 00:47:41,197
Goddamn! I gotta tell you, I'm really excited
to see what you're capable of...

505
00:47:41,258 --> 00:47:43,001
if Morpheus is right and all.

506
00:47:43,510 --> 00:47:46,261
We're not supposed to talk about this, but...

507
00:47:46,412 --> 00:47:47,923
if you are...

508
00:47:49,015 --> 00:47:51,008
it's a very exciting time.

509
00:47:51,960 --> 00:47:53,133
We got a lot to do.

510
00:47:53,434 --> 00:47:54,534
We gotta get to it.

511
00:47:57,109 --> 00:47:58,177
Now...

512
00:47:58,693 --> 00:48:01,610
We're supposed to start with these operation programs first.

513
00:48:02,513 --> 00:48:06,065
That's major boring shit.
Let's do something little more fun.

514
00:48:06,409 --> 00:48:07,903
How about...

515
00:48:09,354 --> 00:48:11,197
combat training?

516
00:48:16,953 --> 00:48:18,712
"Jujitsu"?

517
00:48:19,589 --> 00:48:21,849
I'm going to learn jujitsu?

518
00:48:32,603 --> 00:48:33,801
Holy shit!

519
00:48:33,963 --> 00:48:36,388
"Hey, Mikey, I think he likes it."

520
00:48:36,732 --> 00:48:38,013
How about some more?

521
00:48:38,176 --> 00:48:39,556
Hell, yes.

522
00:48:41,571 --> 00:48:42,686
Hell, yeah.

523
00:48:54,993 --> 00:48:55,956
How is he?

524
00:48:56,211 --> 00:48:58,418
Ten hours straight.
He's a machine.

525
00:49:09,600 --> 00:49:10,976
I know kung fu.

526
00:49:12,846 --> 00:49:13,677
Show me.

527
00:49:15,340 --> 00:49:17,184
This is a sparring program...

528
00:49:17,442 --> 00:49:20,229
similar to the programmed reality of the Matrix.

529
00:49:20,387 --> 00:49:22,812
It has the same basic rules.
Rules like gravity.

530
00:49:22,973 --> 00:49:26,725
What you must learn is that these rules are no
different than the rules of a computer system.

531
00:49:26,977 --> 00:49:28,572
Some of them can be bent.

532
00:49:28,788 --> 00:49:31,243
Others can be broken.

533
00:49:31,824 --> 00:49:32,868
Understand?

534
00:49:34,168 --> 00:49:36,506
Then hit me, if you can.

535
00:50:15,887 --> 00:50:16,750
Good!

536
00:50:17,406 --> 00:50:18,669
Adaptation.

537
00:50:18,865 --> 00:50:20,163
Improvisation.

538
00:50:20,466 --> 00:50:21,795
But your weakness...

539
00:50:21,852 --> 00:50:23,327
is not your technique.

540
00:50:30,294 --> 00:50:32,471
Morpheus is fighting Neo.

541
00:51:44,664 --> 00:51:45,927
How did I beat you?

542
00:51:52,422 --> 00:51:53,801
You're too fast.

543
00:51:54,049 --> 00:51:55,477
Do you believe that...

544
00:51:55,759 --> 00:51:58,350
my being stronger or faster...

545
00:51:58,412 --> 00:52:02,278
has anything to do with my muscles in this place?

546
00:52:06,228 --> 00:52:08,620
You think that's air you're breathing now.

547
00:52:21,636 --> 00:52:22,834
Again!

548
00:52:34,217 --> 00:52:36,725
Jesus Christ, he's fast!

549
00:52:36,985 --> 00:52:39,192
Take a look. His neuro-kinetics are way above normal.

550
00:52:44,661 --> 00:52:46,119
What are you waiting for?

551
00:52:46,171 --> 00:52:48,328
You're faster than this.

552
00:52:50,442 --> 00:52:52,748
Don't think you are.

553
00:52:53,002 --> 00:52:54,662
Know you are.

554
00:53:04,957 --> 00:53:07,792
Come on! Stop trying to hit me, and hit me!

555
00:53:17,779 --> 00:53:19,523
I don't believe it.

556
00:53:20,974 --> 00:53:23,197
I know what you're trying to do.

557
00:53:24,769 --> 00:53:27,028
I'm trying to free your mind, Neo.

558
00:53:27,372 --> 00:53:29,448
But I can only show you the door.

559
00:53:29,942 --> 00:53:32,116
You are the one that have to walk through it.

560
00:53:34,155 --> 00:53:36,378
Tank, load the jump program.

561
00:53:47,907 --> 00:53:49,724
You have to let it all go, Neo.

562
00:53:49,725 --> 00:53:50,725
Fear...

563
00:53:51,031 --> 00:53:53,490
doubt and disbelief.

564
00:53:54,550 --> 00:53:57,272
Free your mind.

565
00:54:13,362 --> 00:54:15,170
Okey-dokey.

566
00:54:17,258 --> 00:54:18,421
Free my mind.

567
00:54:19,085 --> 00:54:20,000
What if he makes it?

568
00:54:20,262 --> 00:54:22,967
- No one's ever made their first jump.
- That I know. I Know.

569
00:54:24,307 --> 00:54:27,063
- But what if he does?
- He won't.

570
00:54:27,668 --> 00:54:28,431
Come on.

571
00:54:28,687 --> 00:54:29,849
All right.

572
00:54:30,313 --> 00:54:32,353
No problem. Free my mind.

573
00:54:33,050 --> 00:54:35,937
Free my mind. No problem. Right.

574
00:54:55,340 --> 00:54:57,000
What does that mean?

575
00:54:57,283 --> 00:54:59,211
It doesn't mean anything.

576
00:54:59,703 --> 00:55:02,377
Everybody falls the first time.

577
00:55:02,748 --> 00:55:04,129
Right, Trin?

578
00:55:24,830 --> 00:55:27,751
- I thought it wasn't real.
- Your mind makes it real.

579
00:55:30,610 --> 00:55:32,953
If you're killed in the Matrix...

580
00:55:33,330 --> 00:55:34,161
you die here?

581
00:55:34,698 --> 00:55:37,254
The body cannot live without the mind.

582
00:56:07,750 --> 00:56:11,119
I don't remember you ever bringing me dinner.

583
00:56:14,214 --> 00:56:17,050
There is something about him, isn't there?

584
00:56:17,477 --> 00:56:19,301
Don't tell me you're a believer now?

585
00:56:20,305 --> 00:56:21,403
I just keep wondering...

586
00:56:21,465 --> 00:56:25,430
if Morpheus is so sure, why he isn't
taking him to see the Oracle?

587
00:56:26,153 --> 00:56:29,270
Morpheus will take him when he's ready.

588
00:56:39,075 --> 00:56:40,617
The Matrix is a system, Neo.

589
00:56:42,169 --> 00:56:43,650
That system is our enemy.

590
00:56:44,088 --> 00:56:46,713
But when you're inside, you look around, what do you see?

591
00:56:46,774 --> 00:56:50,658
Businessmen, teachers, lawyers, carpenters.

592
00:56:51,129 --> 00:56:53,703
The very minds of the people we are trying to save.

593
00:56:53,965 --> 00:56:59,200
But until we do, these people are still a part of that
system and that makes them our enemy.

594
00:56:59,210 --> 00:57:00,462
You have to understand...

595
00:57:00,822 --> 00:57:04,056
most of these people are not ready to be unplugged.

596
00:57:04,309 --> 00:57:08,605
And many of them are so inert so hopelessly
dependent on the system...

597
00:57:08,614 --> 00:57:11,519
that they will fight to protect it.

598
00:57:13,026 --> 00:57:16,775
Were you listening to me Neo or were you
looking at the woman in the red dress?

599
00:57:17,056 --> 00:57:18,488
- I was...
- Look again.

600
00:57:19,951 --> 00:57:21,030
Freeze it.

601
00:57:25,240 --> 00:57:26,431
This...

602
00:57:27,468 --> 00:57:29,291
- this isn't the Matrix?
- No.

603
00:57:30,987 --> 00:57:34,520
It's another training program designed to teach you one thing:

604
00:57:35,451 --> 00:57:37,958
If you are not one of us, you are one of them.

605
00:57:38,512 --> 00:57:41,300
- What are they?
- Sentient programs.

606
00:57:41,758 --> 00:57:46,351
They can move in and out of any software
still hardwired to their system.

607
00:57:46,429 --> 00:57:50,098
That means that anyone we haven't unplugged...

608
00:57:50,241 --> 00:57:51,770
is potentially an agent.

609
00:57:52,735 --> 00:57:54,562
Inside the Matrix...

610
00:57:55,155 --> 00:57:56,863
they are everyone...

611
00:57:57,099 --> 00:57:58,907
and they are no one.

612
00:57:59,158 --> 00:58:02,278
We are survived by hiding from them by running from them...

613
00:58:02,237 --> 00:58:04,162
but they are the gatekeepers.

614
00:58:04,114 --> 00:58:08,760
They're guarding all the doors. They are holding all
the keys, which means that Sooner or later,

615
00:58:08,761 --> 00:58:10,640
someone is going to have to fight them.

616
00:58:10,629 --> 00:58:11,828
Someone?

617
00:58:11,973 --> 00:58:13,584
I won't lie to you, Neo.

618
00:58:13,750 --> 00:58:18,877
Every single man or woman who has stood their ground.
Everyone who has fought an agent has died.

619
00:58:18,938 --> 00:58:21,510
But where they have failed, you will succeed.

620
00:58:22,024 --> 00:58:22,656
Why?

621
00:58:22,617 --> 00:58:25,306
I've seen an agent punch through a concrete wall.

622
00:58:25,362 --> 00:58:29,145
Men have emptied entire clips at them and hit nothing but air.

623
00:58:29,199 --> 00:58:33,926
Yet their strength and their speed are still
based in a world it is built on rules.

624
00:58:33,979 --> 00:58:35,294
Because of that...

625
00:58:35,455 --> 00:58:39,025
they will never be as strong or as fast as you can be.

626
00:58:43,031 --> 00:58:45,204
What are you trying to tell me?

627
00:58:45,816 --> 00:58:47,375
That I can dodge bullets?

628
00:58:49,178 --> 00:58:50,754
No, Neo.

629
00:58:51,155 --> 00:58:54,173
I'm trying to tell you that when you're ready...

630
00:58:54,851 --> 00:58:56,427
you won't have to.

631
00:59:01,023 --> 00:59:01,655
<i>We got trouble.</i>

632
00:59:20,661 --> 00:59:23,117
- Did Zion send the warning?
- No, another ship.

633
00:59:25,876 --> 00:59:27,157
Shit.

634
00:59:27,419 --> 00:59:30,790
- Squiddy's sweeping in quick.
- Squiddy?

635
00:59:30,806 --> 00:59:33,909
A sentinel. A killing machine designed for one thing.

636
00:59:33,967 --> 00:59:35,766
Search and destroy.

637
00:59:36,812 --> 00:59:38,175
Set her down right over there.

638
00:59:59,895 --> 01:00:01,117
How are we doing, Tank?

639
01:00:09,571 --> 01:00:10,734
Power off-line.

640
01:00:11,240 --> 01:00:13,233
EMP armed...

641
01:00:13,509 --> 01:00:15,283
- and ready.
- EMP?

642
01:00:15,578 --> 01:00:17,451
Electromagnetic pulse.

643
01:00:17,705 --> 01:00:20,575
Disables any electrical system in the blast radius.

644
01:00:20,833 --> 01:00:23,040
It's the only weapon we have against the machines.

645
01:00:29,042 --> 01:00:32,462
- Where are we?
- Their old service and waste systems.

646
01:00:33,604 --> 01:00:34,336
Sewers.

647
01:00:34,556 --> 01:00:37,261
There used to be cities that spanned hundreds of miles.

648
01:00:37,768 --> 01:00:39,777
Now these sewers are all that's left of them.

649
01:00:39,937 --> 01:00:41,265
Quiet.

650
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:23,833
Neo.

651
01:01:25,151 --> 01:01:27,310
You scared the bejesus out of me.

652
01:01:28,405 --> 01:01:30,314
- Sorry.
- It's okay.

653
01:01:33,243 --> 01:01:35,600
- Is that...?
- The Matrix.

654
01:01:36,113 --> 01:01:37,113
Yeah.

655
01:01:38,982 --> 01:01:42,249
- Do you always look at it encoded?
- Well, you have to.

656
01:01:42,403 --> 01:01:45,587
The image translators work for the construct program.

657
01:01:45,840 --> 01:01:49,255
But there's way too much information to decode the Matrix.

658
01:01:49,510 --> 01:01:52,464
You get used to it.
I don't even see the code.

659
01:01:52,722 --> 01:01:56,138
All I see is blonde, brunette, redhead.

660
01:01:56,470 --> 01:01:57,139
Hey...

661
01:01:57,310 --> 01:01:58,686
Do you...

662
01:01:58,979 --> 01:02:00,058
want a drink?

663
01:02:00,313 --> 01:02:01,345
Sure.

664
01:02:04,901 --> 01:02:06,360
You know...

665
01:02:07,279 --> 01:02:08,821
I know what you're thinking.

666
01:02:09,072 --> 01:02:11,195
Because right now I'm thinking the same thing.

667
01:02:11,492 --> 01:02:14,825
Actually, I've been thinking it ever since I got here.

668
01:02:16,747 --> 01:02:19,749
Why, oh, why didn't I take the blue pill?

669
01:02:32,139 --> 01:02:34,048
Good shit, huh?

670
01:02:34,391 --> 01:02:35,588
Dozer makes it.

671
01:02:36,059 --> 01:02:37,221
It's good for two things:

672
01:02:37,477 --> 01:02:40,562
Degreasing engines and killing brain cells.

673
01:02:41,765 --> 01:02:43,772
So can I ask you something?

674
01:02:46,779 --> 01:02:48,404
Did he tell you why he did it?

675
01:02:50,933 --> 01:02:52,860
Why you're here?

676
01:02:56,539 --> 01:02:58,283
Jesus!

677
01:02:59,501 --> 01:03:01,410
What a mind job.

678
01:03:02,738 --> 01:03:05,625
So you're here to save the world.

679
01:03:07,133 --> 01:03:09,209
What do you say to something like that?

680
01:03:14,391 --> 01:03:15,967
A little piece of advice.

681
01:03:17,362 --> 01:03:18,972
You see an agent...

682
01:03:19,313 --> 01:03:21,602
you do what we do:

683
01:03:21,940 --> 01:03:23,483
Run.

684
01:03:23,818 --> 01:03:25,561
You run your ass off.

685
01:03:32,828 --> 01:03:34,536
Thanks for the drink.

686
01:03:39,250 --> 01:03:40,413
Sweet dreams.

687
01:03:44,423 --> 01:03:47,839
Do we have a deal, Mr. Reagan?

688
01:03:48,511 --> 01:03:49,626
You know...

689
01:03:51,055 --> 01:03:53,510
I know this steak doesn't exist.

690
01:03:54,517 --> 01:03:57,269
I know that when I put it in my mouth...

691
01:03:57,520 --> 01:04:00,605
the Matrix is telling my brain that it is...

692
01:04:00,899 --> 01:04:02,013
juicy...

693
01:04:02,317 --> 01:04:04,025
and delicious.

694
01:04:06,847 --> 01:04:08,491
After nine years...

695
01:04:09,240 --> 01:04:10,783
you know what I realize?

696
01:04:18,626 --> 01:04:19,924
Ignorance is bliss.

697
01:04:24,782 --> 01:04:26,709
Then we have a deal.

698
01:04:29,200 --> 01:04:31,130
I don't want to remember nothing.

699
01:04:31,389 --> 01:04:33,927
Nothing. You understand?

700
01:04:37,979 --> 01:04:39,770
And I want to be rich.

701
01:04:41,107 --> 01:04:43,812
You know, someone important.

702
01:04:45,320 --> 01:04:46,435
Like an actor.

703
01:04:47,656 --> 01:04:50,777
Whatever you want, Mr. Reagan.

704
01:04:52,954 --> 01:04:54,495
Okay.

705
01:04:54,872 --> 01:04:57,280
You get my body back in a power plant...

706
01:04:57,667 --> 01:04:59,410
reinsert me into the Matrix...

707
01:04:59,752 --> 01:05:01,163
I'll get you what you want.

708
01:05:01,421 --> 01:05:03,414
Access codes to the Zion mainframe.

709
01:05:03,673 --> 01:05:05,832
No. I told you, I don't know them.

710
01:05:08,703 --> 01:05:10,796
I can get you the man who does.

711
01:05:11,456 --> 01:05:13,348
Morpheus.

712
01:05:23,444 --> 01:05:26,895
Here you go, buddy.
Breakfast of champions.

713
01:05:28,240 --> 01:05:31,028
If you close your eyes, it almost feels
like you're eating runny eggs.

714
01:05:30,986 --> 01:05:33,278
Yeah. Or a bowl of snot.

715
01:05:33,496 --> 01:05:35,074
You know what it really reminds me of?

716
01:05:36,717 --> 01:05:39,241
Tastee Wheat. Did you ever eat Tastee Wheat?

717
01:05:39,778 --> 01:05:41,586
No, but technically, neither did you.

718
01:05:41,538 --> 01:05:43,878
That's exactly my point. Exactly.

719
01:05:44,102 --> 01:05:45,478
Because you have to wonder...

720
01:05:45,729 --> 01:05:48,980
how do the machines really know what
Tastee Wheat tasted like. Huh!

721
01:05:49,233 --> 01:05:50,644
Maybe they got it wrong.

722
01:05:50,902 --> 01:05:54,105
Maybe what I think Tastee Wheat
tasted like actually tasted like...

723
01:05:54,405 --> 01:05:56,397
oatmeal or tuna fish.

724
01:05:56,782 --> 01:05:59,618
That makes you wonder about a lot of things.
You take chicken, for example.

725
01:05:59,869 --> 01:06:04,200
Maybe they couldn't figure out what to make chicken taste
like which is why chicken tastes like everything.

726
01:06:04,416 --> 01:06:06,207
- And maybe they...
- Shut up Mouse.

727
01:06:07,936 --> 01:06:12,580
It's a single-celled protein combined with synthetic
aminos, vitamins and minerals.

728
01:06:12,841 --> 01:06:14,086
Everything the body needs.

729
01:06:14,242 --> 01:06:17,213
It doesn't have everything the body needs.

730
01:06:19,974 --> 01:06:23,058
So, I understand that you've run through
the agent training program.

731
01:06:24,103 --> 01:06:26,142
You know, I wrote that program.

732
01:06:26,438 --> 01:06:27,719
Here it comes.

733
01:06:27,782 --> 01:06:29,939
- So what did you think of her?
- Of who?

734
01:06:30,318 --> 01:06:33,354
The woman in the red dress.
I designed her.

735
01:06:33,696 --> 01:06:36,448
She doesn't talk very much but...

736
01:06:36,700 --> 01:06:40,649
but if you'd like to meet her, I can arrange
a much more personal milieu.

737
01:06:40,912 --> 01:06:42,287
The digital pimp hard at work.

738
01:06:42,539 --> 01:06:44,781
Pay no attention to these hypocrites, Neo.

739
01:06:46,084 --> 01:06:47,911
To deny our own impulses...

740
01:06:48,170 --> 01:06:51,290
is to deny the very thing that makes us human.

741
01:06:53,217 --> 01:06:54,593
Dozer, when you're done...

742
01:06:54,844 --> 01:06:56,254
bring the ship up to broadcast depth.

743
01:06:56,971 --> 01:06:58,299
We're going in.

744
01:06:59,114 --> 01:07:00,425
I'm taking Neo to see her.

745
01:07:04,962 --> 01:07:05,594
See who?

746
01:07:06,606 --> 01:07:07,851
The Oracle.

747
01:07:13,363 --> 01:07:14,905
Everyone, please observe...

748
01:07:15,240 --> 01:07:17,945
the "fasten seat belt" and "no smoking"
signs are being turned on.

749
01:07:18,452 --> 01:07:21,821
Sit back and enjoy your flight.

750
01:07:46,548 --> 01:07:47,379
We're in.

751
01:08:03,015 --> 01:08:04,030
We'll be back in an hour.

752
01:08:18,849 --> 01:08:20,260
Unbelievable...

753
01:08:21,101 --> 01:08:22,430
isn't it?

754
01:08:26,024 --> 01:08:27,851
- God!
- What?

755
01:08:28,525 --> 01:08:29,901
I used to eat there.

756
01:08:32,154 --> 01:08:33,779
Really good noodles.

757
01:08:38,578 --> 01:08:41,070
I have these memories from my life.

758
01:08:43,441 --> 01:08:45,201
None of them happened.

759
01:08:46,135 --> 01:08:47,164
What does that mean?

760
01:08:47,320 --> 01:08:49,627
That the Matrix cannot tell you who you are.

761
01:08:50,549 --> 01:08:51,847
But an oracle can?

762
01:08:52,218 --> 01:08:53,416
That's different.

763
01:08:58,583 --> 01:09:00,340
Did you go to her?

764
01:09:00,935 --> 01:09:02,097
Yes.

765
01:09:02,603 --> 01:09:03,979
What did she tell you?

766
01:09:07,233 --> 01:09:08,728
She told me...

767
01:09:09,778 --> 01:09:10,941
What?

768
01:09:14,741 --> 01:09:15,644
We're here.

769
01:09:16,431 --> 01:09:18,538
Neo, come with me.

770
01:09:38,725 --> 01:09:41,216
So is this the same oracle that made the...

771
01:09:41,695 --> 01:09:42,657
prophecy?

772
01:09:42,713 --> 01:09:47,142
Yes. She's very old. She's been with us since the beginning.

773
01:09:47,609 --> 01:09:49,902
- The beginning?
- Of the Resistance.

774
01:09:51,864 --> 01:09:54,736
And she knows what? Everything?

775
01:09:56,285 --> 01:09:58,495
She would say she knows enough.

776
01:09:59,330 --> 01:10:01,121
And she's never wrong.

777
01:10:03,334 --> 01:10:06,501
Try not to think of it in terms of right and wrong.

778
01:10:06,838 --> 01:10:08,416
She is a guide, Neo.

779
01:10:08,698 --> 01:10:10,672
She can help you to find the path.

780
01:10:11,559 --> 01:10:12,422
She helped you?

781
01:10:13,100 --> 01:10:14,123
Yes.

782
01:10:14,830 --> 01:10:16,258
What did she tell you?

783
01:10:18,725 --> 01:10:20,932
That I would find the One.

784
01:10:34,075 --> 01:10:36,398
I told you I can only show you the door.

785
01:10:36,911 --> 01:10:38,987
You have to walk through it.

786
01:10:42,793 --> 01:10:43,872
Hello, Neo.

787
01:10:44,127 --> 01:10:45,788
You're right on time.

788
01:10:53,621 --> 01:10:57,505
Make yourself at home, Morpheus.
Neo, come with me.

789
01:11:03,188 --> 01:11:04,766
These are the other Potentials.

790
01:11:05,024 --> 01:11:06,666
You can wait here.

791
01:11:47,403 --> 01:11:49,940
Do not try and bend the spoon.

792
01:11:50,322 --> 01:11:52,445
That's impossible.

793
01:11:53,283 --> 01:11:57,281
Instead, only try to realize the truth.

794
01:11:57,830 --> 01:11:59,205
What truth?

795
01:11:59,457 --> 01:12:01,117
There is no spoon.

796
01:12:03,711 --> 01:12:05,039
There is no spoon?

797
01:12:05,296 --> 01:12:10,492
Then you'll see that it is not the spoon
that bends. It is only yourself.

798
01:12:25,818 --> 01:12:27,312
The Oracle will see you now.

799
01:12:37,997 --> 01:12:39,839
I know you're Neo.

800
01:12:40,166 --> 01:12:41,529
Be right with you.

801
01:12:42,377 --> 01:12:44,749
- You're the Oracle?
- Bingo.

802
01:12:47,366 --> 01:12:50,336
Not quite what you were expecting, right?

803
01:12:51,386 --> 01:12:53,545
Almost done.

804
01:12:56,058 --> 01:12:57,783
Smell good, don't they?

805
01:12:59,465 --> 01:13:00,184
Yeah.

806
01:13:00,438 --> 01:13:02,265
I'd ask you to sit down...

807
01:13:02,523 --> 01:13:04,895
but you're not going to anyway.

808
01:13:05,331 --> 01:13:08,402
- And don't worry about the vase.
- What vase?

809
01:13:11,537 --> 01:13:12,700
That vase.

810
01:13:13,565 --> 01:13:14,696
I'm sorry.

811
01:13:14,958 --> 01:13:16,832
I said, don't worry about it.

812
01:13:18,003 --> 01:13:20,259
I'll get one of my kids to fix it.

813
01:13:20,588 --> 01:13:21,786
How did you know?

814
01:13:23,742 --> 01:13:27,626
What's really going to bake your noodle later on is...

815
01:13:27,771 --> 01:13:31,226
would you still have broken it if I hadn't said anything?

816
01:13:35,629 --> 01:13:37,639
You're cuter than I thought.

817
01:13:40,593 --> 01:13:42,935
I can see why she likes you.

818
01:13:43,722 --> 01:13:44,901
Who?

819
01:13:44,956 --> 01:13:46,983
Not too bright, though.

820
01:13:50,187 --> 01:13:53,371
You know why Morpheus brought you to see me.

821
01:13:55,400 --> 01:13:56,663
So...

822
01:13:57,328 --> 01:13:58,903
what do you think?

823
01:14:00,640 --> 01:14:02,483
Do you think you are the One?

824
01:14:04,452 --> 01:14:05,783
Honestly. I don't know.

825
01:14:08,914 --> 01:14:10,525
You know what that means?

826
01:14:11,167 --> 01:14:12,330
It's Latin.

827
01:14:12,710 --> 01:14:14,917
Means, "Know thyself."

828
01:14:16,381 --> 01:14:18,338
I'll let you in on a little secret.

829
01:14:20,594 --> 01:14:24,426
Being the One is just like being in love.

830
01:14:25,140 --> 01:14:28,011
No one can tell you you're in love.
You just know it...

831
01:14:28,268 --> 01:14:29,383
through and through.

832
01:14:29,728 --> 01:14:31,768
Balls to bones.

833
01:14:34,317 --> 01:14:36,191
Well...

834
01:14:37,111 --> 01:14:39,187
I'd better have a look at you.

835
01:14:40,531 --> 01:14:42,025
Open your mouth. Say, "Ah."

836
01:14:56,423 --> 01:14:58,083
Okay...

837
01:14:58,717 --> 01:15:03,676
Now I'm supposed to say, "Hmm, that's interesting, but..."

838
01:15:04,182 --> 01:15:05,296
Then you say:

839
01:15:05,892 --> 01:15:07,171
But what?

840
01:15:07,434 --> 01:15:11,384
But you already know what I'm going to tell you.

841
01:15:12,815 --> 01:15:15,770
- I'm not the One.
- Sorry, kid.

842
01:15:17,304 --> 01:15:19,397
You got the gift...

843
01:15:20,407 --> 01:15:23,113
but it looks like you're waiting for something.

844
01:15:27,497 --> 01:15:31,448
- What?
- Your next life, maybe. Who knows?

845
01:15:32,044 --> 01:15:34,286
That's the way these things go.

846
01:15:35,173 --> 01:15:37,745
- What's funny?
- Morpheus.

847
01:15:38,298 --> 01:15:39,346
He...

848
01:15:41,220 --> 01:15:42,928
He almost had me convinced.

849
01:15:42,981 --> 01:15:44,295
I know.

850
01:15:45,850 --> 01:15:47,973
Poor Morpheus.

851
01:15:50,355 --> 01:15:53,474
Without him, we're lost.

852
01:15:54,800 --> 01:15:57,185
What do you mean, "without him"?

853
01:16:01,100 --> 01:16:03,109
Are you sure you want to hear this?

854
01:16:05,329 --> 01:16:08,081
Morpheus believes in you, Neo.

855
01:16:09,692 --> 01:16:14,500
And no one, not you, not even me can convince him otherwise.

856
01:16:14,739 --> 01:16:17,211
He believes it so blindly...

857
01:16:17,309 --> 01:16:21,839
that he's going to sacrifice his life to save yours.

858
01:16:22,097 --> 01:16:26,046
- What?
- You're going to have to make a choice.

859
01:16:26,485 --> 01:16:30,268
In the one hand, you'll have Morpheus' life.

860
01:16:30,673 --> 01:16:33,943
And in the other hand, you'll have your own.

861
01:16:35,069 --> 01:16:37,358
One of you is going to die.

862
01:16:39,448 --> 01:16:42,834
Which one will be up to you.

863
01:16:44,120 --> 01:16:46,029
I'm sorry, kiddo. I really am.

864
01:16:46,189 --> 01:16:47,749
You have a good soul.

865
01:16:48,842 --> 01:16:52,247
And I hate giving good people bad news.

866
01:16:54,881 --> 01:16:56,340
Don't worry about it.

867
01:16:56,491 --> 01:16:58,999
As soon as you step outside that door...

868
01:16:59,061 --> 01:17:01,384
you'll start feeling better.

869
01:17:02,097 --> 01:17:05,882
You'll remember you don't believe in any of this fate crap.

870
01:17:06,627 --> 01:17:09,479
You're in control of your own life.

871
01:17:10,214 --> 01:17:11,594
Remember?

872
01:17:13,484 --> 01:17:15,144
Here...

873
01:17:16,262 --> 01:17:17,905
take a cookie.

874
01:17:18,448 --> 01:17:21,782
I promise, by the time you're done eating it...

875
01:17:22,744 --> 01:17:25,116
you'll feel right as rain.

876
01:17:34,340 --> 01:17:35,668
What was said...

877
01:17:36,200 --> 01:17:37,759
was for you...

878
01:17:38,202 --> 01:17:40,129
and for you alone.

879
01:18:03,278 --> 01:18:04,193
They're on the way.

880
01:18:34,386 --> 01:18:35,117
What is that?

881
01:18:49,794 --> 01:18:51,205
Oh, déjà vu.

882
01:18:54,716 --> 01:18:55,796
What did you just say?

883
01:18:55,951 --> 01:18:57,545
Nothing.
Just said a little déjà vu.

884
01:18:57,802 --> 01:18:59,427
- What did you see?
- What happened?

885
01:19:00,847 --> 01:19:03,006
A black cat went past us...

886
01:19:03,367 --> 01:19:04,891
and then another that look just like it.

887
01:19:04,944 --> 01:19:06,686
How much like it. Was it the same cat?

888
01:19:07,646 --> 01:19:08,845
Might it be. I'm not sure.

889
01:19:09,449 --> 01:19:11,140
Switch, Apoc.

890
01:19:15,037 --> 01:19:15,468
What is it?

891
01:19:15,530 --> 01:19:20,443
A déjà vu is usually a glitch in the Matrix.
It happened when they change something.

892
01:19:23,922 --> 01:19:24,653
Oh, my God.

893
01:19:26,600 --> 01:19:28,175
Let's go.

894
01:19:32,714 --> 01:19:34,458
They cut the hard line.
It's a trap! Get out!

895
01:19:40,314 --> 01:19:41,212
Oh, no.

896
01:19:42,684 --> 01:19:43,714
Oh, no.

897
01:20:21,516 --> 01:20:23,972
Ah! That's what they changed.
We're trapped. There is no way out.

898
01:20:24,227 --> 01:20:26,101
Be calm. Give me your phone.

899
01:20:26,355 --> 01:20:27,897
They'll be able to track it.

900
01:20:28,048 --> 01:20:29,558
We have no choice.

901
01:20:30,884 --> 01:20:32,182
<i>- Operator.
- Tank.</i>

902
01:20:32,327 --> 01:20:35,363
<i>Find a structural drawing of this building. Find it fast.</i>

903
01:20:43,106 --> 01:20:45,778
<i>- Got it!
- I need the main wet-wall.</i>

904
01:20:48,994 --> 01:20:49,874
Eighth floor.

905
01:20:50,087 --> 01:20:51,465
<i>They're on the eighth floor.</i>

906
01:20:51,865 --> 01:20:53,424
Switch, straight ahead.

907
01:20:54,100 --> 01:20:55,125
Neo.

908
01:21:01,374 --> 01:21:03,633
I hope the Oracle gave you some good news.

909
01:21:11,803 --> 01:21:13,297
<i>Now left. That's it.</i>

910
01:21:13,596 --> 01:21:14,728
Good.

911
01:21:24,457 --> 01:21:25,738
Where are they?

912
01:22:26,189 --> 01:22:27,352
They're in the walls.

913
01:22:28,817 --> 01:22:29,980
In the walls!

914
01:22:51,382 --> 01:22:53,090
It's an agent!

915
01:23:00,200 --> 01:23:01,560
- Morpheus.
- Trinity.

916
01:23:01,719 --> 01:23:04,522
You must get Neo out!
He's all that matters!

917
01:23:04,680 --> 01:23:06,678
No. No, Morpheus! Don't!

918
01:23:06,940 --> 01:23:08,482
Trinity, go!

919
01:23:08,650 --> 01:23:10,026
Go!

920
01:23:16,242 --> 01:23:18,151
- We can't leave him!
- We have to!

921
01:23:42,637 --> 01:23:44,430
Cypher. Come on!

922
01:23:49,193 --> 01:23:53,025
The great Morpheus.
We meet at last.

923
01:23:53,273 --> 01:23:54,687
And you are?

924
01:23:54,849 --> 01:23:56,393
A Smith.

925
01:23:56,851 --> 01:23:58,132
Agent Smith.

926
01:23:58,828 --> 01:24:00,868
You all look the same to me.

927
01:24:56,514 --> 01:24:57,795
Take him.

928
01:25:04,280 --> 01:25:05,244
No.

929
01:25:11,029 --> 01:25:12,856
<i>- Operator.
- Yeah. I need an exit, fast.</i>

930
01:25:13,250 --> 01:25:14,640
<i>- Cypher.
- Yeah.</i>

931
01:25:14,841 --> 01:25:17,700
There was an accident. Goddamn car accident.

932
01:25:18,004 --> 01:25:19,996
<i>All of a sudden, boom.</i>

933
01:25:20,248 --> 01:25:21,622
Somebody up there still likes me.

934
01:25:21,874 --> 01:25:23,119
I got you.

935
01:25:23,726 --> 01:25:25,535
<i>Just get me out of here fast.</i>

936
01:25:25,795 --> 01:25:28,464
Nearest exit, Franklin and Erie.
An old TV repair shop.

937
01:25:28,715 --> 01:25:29,746
Right.

938
01:25:32,786 --> 01:25:34,464
<i>- Operator.
- Tank, it's me.</i>

939
01:25:34,621 --> 01:25:35,884
Is Morpheus alive?

940
01:25:36,264 --> 01:25:37,544
Is Morpheus alive, Tank?

941
01:25:37,974 --> 01:25:39,884
<i>Yes. They're moving him.
I don 't know where to, Yet.</i>

942
01:25:40,001 --> 01:25:43,553
- He's alive. We need an exit.
- You're not far from Cypher.

943
01:25:43,714 --> 01:25:45,143
<i>- Cypher?
- I know.</i>

944
01:25:45,399 --> 01:25:47,475
<i>- I sent him to Franklin and Erie.
- Got it.</i>

945
01:25:56,577 --> 01:25:57,775
Got him.

946
01:26:08,715 --> 01:26:09,746
Where are they?

947
01:26:10,008 --> 01:26:11,253
Making the call.

948
01:26:11,927 --> 01:26:13,090
Good.

949
01:26:26,651 --> 01:26:28,442
You first Neo.

950
01:26:30,655 --> 01:26:31,900
Shit!

951
01:26:37,000 --> 01:26:38,088
No.

952
01:26:40,582 --> 01:26:42,741
I don't know. It just went dead.

953
01:27:09,471 --> 01:27:10,769
<i>Hello, Trinity.</i>

954
01:27:11,197 --> 01:27:12,526
Cypher? Where's Tank?

955
01:27:18,022 --> 01:27:19,153
You know...

956
01:27:20,775 --> 01:27:22,998
for a long time...

957
01:27:24,011 --> 01:27:27,129
I thought I was in love with you.

958
01:27:27,882 --> 01:27:29,922
<i>I used to dream about you.</i>

959
01:27:30,910 --> 01:27:33,715
You're a beautiful woman, Trinity.

960
01:27:33,972 --> 01:27:36,344
<i>Too bad things had to turn out this way.</i>

961
01:27:36,850 --> 01:27:38,130
You killed them.

962
01:27:38,435 --> 01:27:39,929
- What?
- Oh, God.

963
01:27:40,086 --> 01:27:41,597
I'm tired, Trinity.

964
01:27:42,923 --> 01:27:44,897
I'm tired of this war...

965
01:27:45,192 --> 01:27:48,027
tired of fighting. I'm tired of this ship...

966
01:27:48,362 --> 01:27:52,989
of being cold, of eating the same goddamn goop every day.

967
01:27:55,385 --> 01:27:56,517
But most of all...

968
01:27:56,812 --> 01:28:00,282
<i>I'm tired of that jackoff and all of his bullshit.</i>

969
01:28:01,417 --> 01:28:02,698
Surprise, asshole!

970
01:28:03,153 --> 01:28:05,459
I bet you never saw this coming...

971
01:28:05,614 --> 01:28:06,745
did you?

972
01:28:08,951 --> 01:28:11,422
God, I wish I could be there...

973
01:28:11,912 --> 01:28:13,506
when they break you.

974
01:28:14,356 --> 01:28:17,723
I wish I could walk in just when it happens...

975
01:28:18,435 --> 01:28:20,144
so right then...

976
01:28:20,396 --> 01:28:21,725
you'd know it was me.

977
01:28:22,148 --> 01:28:25,101
<i>- You gave them Morpheus.
- He lied to us, Trinity.</i>

978
01:28:25,493 --> 01:28:27,187
He tricked us!

979
01:28:27,636 --> 01:28:29,729
If you would told us the truth...

980
01:28:29,789 --> 01:28:32,860
we would've told you to shove that red pill right up your ass!

981
01:28:33,118 --> 01:28:36,303
<i>- That is not true, Cypher. He set us free.
- "Free."</i>

982
01:28:36,363 --> 01:28:38,371
You call this free?

983
01:28:40,792 --> 01:28:43,283
All I do is what he tells me to do.

984
01:28:44,780 --> 01:28:47,798
If I had to choose between that and the Matrix...

985
01:28:48,768 --> 01:28:50,166
I choose the Matrix.

986
01:28:50,228 --> 01:28:52,088
The Matrix isn't real.

987
01:28:52,246 --> 01:28:53,757
<i>I disagree, Trinity.</i>

988
01:28:53,915 --> 01:28:56,256
I think the Matrix...

989
01:28:56,600 --> 01:28:59,174
can be more real than this world.

990
01:29:01,355 --> 01:29:03,847
All I do is pull the plug here.

991
01:29:04,109 --> 01:29:05,437
But there...

992
01:29:05,886 --> 01:29:07,797
<i>you have to watch Apoc die.</i>

993
01:29:09,690 --> 01:29:10,376
Trinity.

994
01:29:12,844 --> 01:29:13,677
No.

995
01:29:15,938 --> 01:29:17,746
<i>Welcome to the real world. Huh! baby.</i>

996
01:29:18,015 --> 01:29:18,894
But you're out. Cypher.

997
01:29:18,949 --> 01:29:21,657
<i>- You can't go back.
- Oh! No, That's what you think.</i>

998
01:29:21,819 --> 01:29:23,414
<i>They are gonna reinsert my body.</i>

999
01:29:23,571 --> 01:29:27,289
<i>I go back to sleep and When I wake up,
I won't remember a goddamn thing.</i>

1000
01:29:27,449 --> 01:29:28,664
By the way...

1001
01:29:28,643 --> 01:29:31,760
if you have anything terribly important to say to Switch...

1002
01:29:32,063 --> 01:29:34,470
<i>- I suggest you say it now.
- No, please don't.</i>

1003
01:29:34,916 --> 01:29:36,641
Not like this.

1004
01:29:38,253 --> 01:29:39,978
Not like this.

1005
01:29:44,342 --> 01:29:45,474
Too late.

1006
01:29:45,644 --> 01:29:47,522
Goddamn you, Cypher!

1007
01:29:47,679 --> 01:29:49,653
Don't hate me, Trinity.

1008
01:29:49,932 --> 01:29:51,906
I'm just a messenger.

1009
01:29:52,326 --> 01:29:55,493
And right now, I'm gonna prove it to you.

1010
01:29:56,481 --> 01:29:58,240
If Morpheus was right...

1011
01:29:58,691 --> 01:30:00,665
and there's no way I can pull this plug.

1012
01:30:01,252 --> 01:30:02,746
<i>I mean If Neo's the One...</i>

1013
01:30:03,154 --> 01:30:04,981
<i>then there'd have to be some kind of </i>

1014
01:30:05,052 --> 01:30:07,913
a miracle to stop me.

1015
01:30:08,327 --> 01:30:09,655
Right?

1016
01:30:09,828 --> 01:30:13,261
I mean, how can he be the One if he's dead?

1017
01:30:14,541 --> 01:30:16,883
<i>You never did answer me before...</i>

1018
01:30:17,085 --> 01:30:19,511
<i>if you bought into Morpheus' bullshit.</i>

1019
01:30:19,697 --> 01:30:20,300
<i>Come on.</i>

1020
01:30:20,703 --> 01:30:23,501
All I want is a little yes or no.

1021
01:30:24,485 --> 01:30:26,811
Look into his eyes...

1022
01:30:27,471 --> 01:30:29,965
<i>those big, pretty eyes...</i>

1023
01:30:31,626 --> 01:30:32,854
and tell me...

1024
01:30:33,770 --> 01:30:35,150
<i>yes...</i>

1025
01:30:35,455 --> 01:30:36,830
<i>or no.</i>

1026
01:30:38,024 --> 01:30:38,939
Yes.

1027
01:30:38,976 --> 01:30:39,491
<i>No.</i>

1028
01:30:40,020 --> 01:30:41,392
I don't believe it.

1029
01:30:42,421 --> 01:30:47,166
Believe it or not, you piece of shit, you're still gonna burn!

1030
01:31:05,770 --> 01:31:06,815
You first.

1031
01:31:15,171 --> 01:31:15,902
You're hurt.

1032
01:31:16,247 --> 01:31:17,327
I'll be all right.

1033
01:31:20,027 --> 01:31:21,290
Dozer?

1034
01:31:39,564 --> 01:31:41,937
Have you ever stood and stared at it?

1035
01:31:42,818 --> 01:31:45,937
Marveled at its beauty...

1036
01:31:46,221 --> 01:31:48,563
its genius?

1037
01:31:49,741 --> 01:31:54,620
Billions of people just living out their lives.

1038
01:31:55,565 --> 01:31:57,325
Oblivious.

1039
01:32:01,921 --> 01:32:04,792
Did you know that the first Matrix...

1040
01:32:05,049 --> 01:32:09,759
was designed to be a perfect human world where none suffered...

1041
01:32:10,222 --> 01:32:13,139
where everyone would be happy.

1042
01:32:13,484 --> 01:32:15,177
It was a disaster.

1043
01:32:15,435 --> 01:32:19,765
No one would accept the program.
Entire crops were lost.

1044
01:32:20,549 --> 01:32:22,393
Some believe that...

1045
01:32:22,551 --> 01:32:26,929
we lacked the programming language
to describe your perfect world.

1046
01:32:27,081 --> 01:32:35,870
But I believe that, as a species human beings define
their reality through misery and suffering.

1047
01:32:36,124 --> 01:32:38,829
So the perfect world was a dream...

1048
01:32:39,085 --> 01:32:43,914
that your primitive cerebrum kept trying to wake up from.

1049
01:32:45,059 --> 01:32:48,923
Which is why the Matrix was redesigned to this.

1050
01:32:49,287 --> 01:32:52,322
The peak of your civilization.

1051
01:32:52,808 --> 01:32:55,050
I say, "your civilization"...

1052
01:32:55,211 --> 01:32:59,439
because as soon as we started thinking for you,
it really became our civilization...

1053
01:32:59,591 --> 01:33:02,974
which is, of course, what this is all about.

1054
01:33:04,011 --> 01:33:06,685
Evolution, Morpheus.

1055
01:33:06,989 --> 01:33:08,318
Evolution.

1056
01:33:10,519 --> 01:33:12,492
Like the dinosaur.

1057
01:33:14,565 --> 01:33:16,288
Look out that window.

1058
01:33:17,000 --> 01:33:19,123
You had your time.

1059
01:33:19,736 --> 01:33:23,751
The future is our world, Morpheus.

1060
01:33:24,091 --> 01:33:26,463
The future is our time.

1061
01:33:30,431 --> 01:33:31,511
There could be a problem.

1062
01:33:32,808 --> 01:33:36,177
- What are they doing to him?
- They're breaking into his mind.

1063
01:33:36,437 --> 01:33:38,596
It's like hacking a computer.
All it takes is time.

1064
01:33:38,856 --> 01:33:40,055
How much time?

1065
01:33:40,316 --> 01:33:43,437
Depends on the mind.
But eventually, it'll crack...

1066
01:33:43,695 --> 01:33:48,107
and his alpha patterns will change from this to this.

1067
01:33:48,466 --> 01:33:51,320
When it does, Morpheous will tell them
anything they want to know.

1068
01:33:51,578 --> 01:33:52,609
And what do they want?

1069
01:33:52,871 --> 01:33:56,916
The leader of every ship is given codes
to Zion's mainframe computer.

1070
01:33:57,168 --> 01:34:00,085
If an agent got the codes and got into Zion's mainframe...

1071
01:34:00,338 --> 01:34:01,370
they could destroy us.

1072
01:34:01,480 --> 01:34:02,730
We can't let that happen.

1073
01:34:03,058 --> 01:34:03,990
Trinity.

1074
01:34:03,991 --> 01:34:05,800
Zion's more important than me...

1075
01:34:05,852 --> 01:34:07,250
or you...

1076
01:34:07,428 --> 01:34:08,626
or even Morpheus.

1077
01:34:12,334 --> 01:34:14,094
Well, there has to be something that we can do.

1078
01:34:14,419 --> 01:34:16,712
There is. We pull the plug.

1079
01:34:19,507 --> 01:34:21,351
You're gonna kill him?

1080
01:34:21,410 --> 01:34:22,772
Kill Morpheus?

1081
01:34:23,403 --> 01:34:25,228
We don't have any other choice.

1082
01:34:31,729 --> 01:34:34,746
Never send a human to do a machine's job.

1083
01:34:34,999 --> 01:34:40,200
If the Indedian insider has failed they'll sever the
connection as soon as possible, unless...

1084
01:34:40,463 --> 01:34:42,171
They're dead. In either case...

1085
01:34:42,424 --> 01:34:45,959
We have no choice. But continue as planned.
Deploy the sentinels.

1086
01:34:46,220 --> 01:34:47,299
Immediately.

1087
01:34:52,559 --> 01:34:55,229
Morpheus, you were more than a leader to us.

1088
01:34:56,088 --> 01:34:58,395
You were... a father.

1089
01:34:59,842 --> 01:35:01,900
We'll miss you always.

1090
01:35:08,859 --> 01:35:09,988
Stop!

1091
01:35:11,004 --> 01:35:12,402
I don't believe this is happening.

1092
01:35:12,664 --> 01:35:14,704
- Neo, this has to be done.
- Does it?

1093
01:35:15,300 --> 01:35:16,876
I don't know. I...

1094
01:35:17,111 --> 01:35:18,753
This can't be just coincidence. It can't be.

1095
01:35:18,963 --> 01:35:21,120
- What are you talking about?
- The Oracle.

1096
01:35:21,181 --> 01:35:23,072
She told me this would happen.

1097
01:35:23,392 --> 01:35:27,756
She told me that I would have to make a choice.

1098
01:35:28,022 --> 01:35:29,467
What choice?

1099
01:35:32,835 --> 01:35:34,925
- What... what are you doing?
- I'm going in.

1100
01:35:34,970 --> 01:35:37,596
- No, you're not.
- I have to.

1101
01:35:37,815 --> 01:35:41,434
Neo, Morpheus sacrificed himself so that we could get you out.

1102
01:35:41,694 --> 01:35:43,604
There is no way that you're going back in.

1103
01:35:44,197 --> 01:35:47,748
Morpheus did what he did because he
believed that I'm something I'm not.

1104
01:35:49,078 --> 01:35:52,327
- What?
- I'm not the One, Trinity.

1105
01:35:52,606 --> 01:35:55,660
- The Oracle hit me with that too.
- No, you have to be.

1106
01:35:55,818 --> 01:35:58,487
I'm sorry, I'm not.
I'm just another guy.

1107
01:35:58,955 --> 01:36:00,500
No, Neo, that's not true.

1108
01:36:00,890 --> 01:36:02,419
It can't be true.

1109
01:36:02,459 --> 01:36:03,544
Why?

1110
01:36:07,339 --> 01:36:11,473
Neo. This is loco. They've got Morpheus
in a military controlled building.

1111
01:36:11,726 --> 01:36:16,404
Even if you somehow got inside, those are
agents holding him. Three of them.

1112
01:36:17,399 --> 01:36:21,313
I want Morpheus back too, but what
you're talking about is suicide.

1113
01:36:21,269 --> 01:36:24,357
I know that's what it looks like, but it's not.

1114
01:36:24,614 --> 01:36:26,987
I can't explain to you why it's not.

1115
01:36:27,877 --> 01:36:31,778
Morpheus believed something, and he was ready
to give his life for what he believed.

1116
01:36:31,939 --> 01:36:33,280
I understand that now.

1117
01:36:34,000 --> 01:36:35,242
That's why I have to go.

1118
01:36:35,193 --> 01:36:37,830
- Why?
- Because I believe in something.

1119
01:36:38,045 --> 01:36:39,789
What?

1120
01:36:39,839 --> 01:36:42,047
I believe I can bring him back.

1121
01:36:58,626 --> 01:37:00,635
- What are you doing?
- Going with you.

1122
01:37:00,737 --> 01:37:03,338
- No, you're not.
- "No"?

1123
01:37:03,807 --> 01:37:06,129
Let me tell you what I believe.

1124
01:37:06,234 --> 01:37:08,906
I believe Morpheus means more to me than he does to you.

1125
01:37:09,045 --> 01:37:13,240
I believe if you are really serious about saving him,
you are going to need my help.

1126
01:37:13,492 --> 01:37:18,888
And since I am the ranking officer on this ship if
you don't like it, I believe you can go to hell.

1127
01:37:19,615 --> 01:37:22,022
Because you aren't going anywhere else.

1128
01:37:22,451 --> 01:37:23,693
Tank...

1129
01:37:23,861 --> 01:37:25,324
load us up.

1130
01:37:34,723 --> 01:37:38,208
I'd like to share a revelation that I've had...

1131
01:37:38,235 --> 01:37:40,177
during my time here.

1132
01:37:40,328 --> 01:37:44,426
It came to me when I tried to classify your species...

1133
01:37:44,683 --> 01:37:49,470
and I realized that you're not actually mammals.

1134
01:37:51,591 --> 01:37:54,146
Every mammal on this planet...

1135
01:37:54,385 --> 01:37:59,396
instinctively develops a natural equilibrium
with the surrounding environment.

1136
01:37:59,557 --> 01:38:01,584
But you humans do not.

1137
01:38:01,935 --> 01:38:05,570
You move to an area and you multiply...

1138
01:38:05,831 --> 01:38:10,326
and multiply until every natural resource is consumed.

1139
01:38:10,468 --> 01:38:16,000
The only way you can survive is to spread to another area.

1140
01:38:21,430 --> 01:38:26,515
There is another organism on this planet
that follows the same pattern.

1141
01:38:27,044 --> 01:38:28,804
Do you know what it is?

1142
01:38:29,188 --> 01:38:30,815
A virus.

1143
01:38:32,158 --> 01:38:35,395
Human beings are a disease.

1144
01:38:35,679 --> 01:38:37,321
A cancer of this planet.

1145
01:38:37,473 --> 01:38:39,695
You are a plague.

1146
01:38:40,141 --> 01:38:43,196
And we are the cure.

1147
01:38:44,104 --> 01:38:45,615
Okay, so what do you need?

1148
01:38:46,248 --> 01:38:47,363
Besides a miracle.

1149
01:38:47,758 --> 01:38:49,156
Guns.

1150
01:38:50,077 --> 01:38:51,206
Lots of guns.

1151
01:39:01,200 --> 01:39:02,111
Neo.

1152
01:39:04,059 --> 01:39:06,597
No one has ever done anything like this.

1153
01:39:07,713 --> 01:39:09,721
That's why it's going to work.

1154
01:39:13,818 --> 01:39:15,776
Why isn't the serum working?

1155
01:39:16,263 --> 01:39:18,652
Perhaps we're asking the wrong questions.

1156
01:39:20,643 --> 01:39:22,388
Leave me with him.

1157
01:39:24,479 --> 01:39:25,894
Now.

1158
01:39:36,927 --> 01:39:38,504
Hold on, Morpheus.

1159
01:39:38,762 --> 01:39:39,957
They're coming for you.

1160
01:39:40,690 --> 01:39:42,058
They're coming.

1161
01:39:43,850 --> 01:39:45,973
Can you hear me, Morpheus?

1162
01:39:46,228 --> 01:39:48,897
I'm going to be honest...

1163
01:39:49,073 --> 01:39:50,471
with you.

1164
01:39:54,861 --> 01:39:56,272
I...

1165
01:39:57,130 --> 01:39:58,276
hate...

1166
01:39:58,432 --> 01:40:00,490
this place...

1167
01:40:00,826 --> 01:40:03,115
this zoo...

1168
01:40:03,371 --> 01:40:04,486
this prison...

1169
01:40:04,747 --> 01:40:10,356
this reality, whatever you want to call it.
I can't stand it any longer.

1170
01:40:11,112 --> 01:40:13,086
It's the smell.

1171
01:40:14,366 --> 01:40:16,340
If there is such a thing.

1172
01:40:16,676 --> 01:40:19,962
I feel saturated by it.

1173
01:40:21,374 --> 01:40:23,881
I can taste...

1174
01:40:24,727 --> 01:40:26,766
your stink.

1175
01:40:27,020 --> 01:40:30,769
And every time I do, I fear that I have
somehow been infected by it.

1176
01:40:30,825 --> 01:40:32,650
It's repulsive.

1177
01:40:32,819 --> 01:40:34,194
Isn't it?

1178
01:40:36,064 --> 01:40:38,453
I must get out of here.

1179
01:40:38,876 --> 01:40:41,281
I must get free.

1180
01:40:41,536 --> 01:40:44,407
And in this mind is the key.

1181
01:40:44,664 --> 01:40:45,924
My key.

1182
01:40:45,983 --> 01:40:49,454
Once Zion is destroyed, there is no need for me to be here.

1183
01:40:49,411 --> 01:40:51,336
Do you understand?

1184
01:40:51,430 --> 01:40:53,006
I need the codes.

1185
01:40:53,257 --> 01:40:55,583
I have to get inside Zion...

1186
01:40:55,826 --> 01:40:58,417
and you have to tell me how.

1187
01:40:58,646 --> 01:41:00,220
You're going to tell me...

1188
01:41:00,273 --> 01:41:03,132
or you're going to die.

1189
01:41:23,330 --> 01:41:27,375
Will you please remove any metallic items
you're carrying. Keys, loose change.

1190
01:41:30,379 --> 01:41:31,410
Holy shit!

1191
01:41:43,518 --> 01:41:46,223
Backup. Send backup.

1192
01:42:10,205 --> 01:42:11,167
Freeze!

1193
01:44:26,132 --> 01:44:27,455
What were you doing?

1194
01:44:28,868 --> 01:44:30,349
He doesn't know.

1195
01:44:30,611 --> 01:44:32,105
Know what?

1196
01:45:00,184 --> 01:45:02,675
I think they're trying to save him.

1197
01:45:17,435 --> 01:45:19,279
There is no spoon.

1198
01:45:48,701 --> 01:45:51,060
Find them and destroy them!

1199
01:45:52,597 --> 01:45:54,671
I repeat. We're under attack!

1200
01:46:26,468 --> 01:46:27,592
Trinity.

1201
01:46:28,455 --> 01:46:29,693
Help!

1202
01:46:51,226 --> 01:46:52,624
Only human.

1203
01:46:53,720 --> 01:46:55,594
Dodge this.

1204
01:47:07,702 --> 01:47:09,444
- How did you do that?
- Do what?

1205
01:47:09,720 --> 01:47:13,735
You moved like they do.
I've never seen anyone move that fast.

1206
01:47:14,868 --> 01:47:16,543
It wasn't fast enough.

1207
01:47:18,797 --> 01:47:20,277
Can you fly that thing?

1208
01:47:21,524 --> 01:47:23,416
Not yet.

1209
01:47:25,729 --> 01:47:26,343
Operator.

1210
01:47:26,464 --> 01:47:30,031
<i>Tank. I need a pilot program for a B-212 helicopter.</i>

1211
01:47:30,493 --> 01:47:31,873
<i>Hurry.</i>

1212
01:47:39,800 --> 01:47:41,435
Let's go.

1213
01:47:56,536 --> 01:47:57,116
No.

1214
01:48:49,217 --> 01:48:51,838
Morpheus, get up.
Get up, get up.

1215
01:49:29,885 --> 01:49:31,428
He's not gonna make it.

1216
01:49:40,700 --> 01:49:41,761
Got you.

1217
01:50:47,900 --> 01:50:48,888
Trinity.

1218
01:51:30,579 --> 01:51:32,090
I knew it.

1219
01:51:32,597 --> 01:51:33,926
He's the One.

1220
01:51:49,808 --> 01:51:52,114
Do you believe it now, Trinity?

1221
01:51:54,800 --> 01:51:55,755
Morpheus.

1222
01:51:57,941 --> 01:51:59,998
The Oracle.

1223
01:52:00,068 --> 01:52:02,540
- She told me...
- She told you...

1224
01:52:02,921 --> 01:52:04,499
exactly what you needed to hear.

1225
01:52:04,698 --> 01:52:06,127
That's all.

1226
01:52:06,976 --> 01:52:10,130
Neo. Sooner or later you are going to realize, just as I did...

1227
01:52:10,371 --> 01:52:12,759
there's a difference between knowing the path...

1228
01:52:13,415 --> 01:52:14,796
and walking the path.

1229
01:52:17,553 --> 01:52:19,052
<i>- Operator.
- Tank.</i>

1230
01:52:19,781 --> 01:52:22,519
<i>- Goddamn. It's good to hear your voice, sir.
- We need an exit.</i>

1231
01:52:22,676 --> 01:52:25,663
Got one ready. Subway station, State and Balboa.

1232
01:52:38,300 --> 01:52:39,478
Damn it!

1233
01:52:39,635 --> 01:52:40,934
The trace was completed.

1234
01:52:40,995 --> 01:52:44,778
- We have their position.
- Sentinels are standing by.

1235
01:52:46,292 --> 01:52:48,086
Order the strike.

1236
01:52:54,343 --> 01:52:56,182
They're not out yet.

1237
01:53:07,523 --> 01:53:08,952
You first, Morpheus.

1238
01:53:29,546 --> 01:53:31,935
Neo, I want to tell you something...

1239
01:53:35,194 --> 01:53:39,144
but I'm afraid of what it could mean if I do.

1240
01:53:42,744 --> 01:53:46,029
Everything the Oracle told me has come true.

1241
01:53:48,791 --> 01:53:50,434
Everything but this.

1242
01:53:51,953 --> 01:53:52,868
But what?

1243
01:54:18,000 --> 01:54:18,800
Neo.

1244
01:54:19,198 --> 01:54:20,823
- What the hell just happened?
- An agent.

1245
01:54:20,875 --> 01:54:23,033
- You have to send me back.
- I can't.

1246
01:54:24,838 --> 01:54:27,031
Mr. Anderson.

1247
01:54:29,208 --> 01:54:30,784
Run, Neo. Run.

1248
01:54:35,883 --> 01:54:37,507
What is he doing?

1249
01:54:37,760 --> 01:54:39,005
He's beginning to believe.

1250
01:55:05,998 --> 01:55:07,373
You're empty.

1251
01:55:07,858 --> 01:55:09,239
So are you.

1252
01:55:42,411 --> 01:55:45,413
I'm gonna enjoy watching you die...

1253
01:55:46,540 --> 01:55:47,571
Mr. Anderson.

1254
01:56:28,443 --> 01:56:30,620
Jesus, he's killing him.

1255
01:57:56,703 --> 01:57:58,926
You hear that, Mr. Anderson?

1256
01:57:59,581 --> 01:58:02,682
That is the sound of inevitability.

1257
01:58:05,270 --> 01:58:08,604
It is the sound of your death.

1258
01:58:09,524 --> 01:58:11,850
Goodbye, Mr. Anderson.

1259
01:58:12,011 --> 01:58:13,735
My name...

1260
01:58:16,641 --> 01:58:18,581
is Neo.

1261
01:58:51,026 --> 01:58:53,149
- What happened?
- I don't know. I lost him.

1262
01:58:55,740 --> 01:58:56,771
Oh, shit.

1263
01:59:09,171 --> 01:59:10,629
Sentinels.

1264
01:59:11,181 --> 01:59:13,923
- How long?
- Five, maybe six minutes.

1265
01:59:15,478 --> 01:59:17,836
Tank, charge the EMP.

1266
01:59:17,997 --> 01:59:21,133
- We can't use that until he's out.
- I know. Trinity. Don't worry.

1267
01:59:22,226 --> 01:59:23,389
He's gonna make it.

1268
01:59:23,444 --> 01:59:25,518
Flat or pumps? No, just...

1269
01:59:25,771 --> 01:59:28,642
What the shit? That's my phone!

1270
01:59:28,767 --> 01:59:30,645
That guy took my phone!

1271
01:59:33,230 --> 01:59:34,900
Got him! He's on the run.

1272
01:59:35,501 --> 01:59:36,401
<i>Mr. Wizard...</i>

1273
01:59:36,666 --> 01:59:38,242
get me the hell out of here!

1274
01:59:38,493 --> 01:59:40,367
<i>I got the patch and old exit.
Wabash and Lake.</i>

1275
01:59:44,516 --> 01:59:46,076
Oh, shit!

1276
02:00:06,598 --> 02:00:08,891
huh! Help! Need a little help!

1277
02:00:10,427 --> 02:00:11,725
<i>The door.</i>

1278
02:00:27,712 --> 02:00:29,206
<i>The door on your left.</i>

1279
02:00:30,131 --> 02:00:31,376
<i>No. Your other left!</i>

1280
02:00:37,997 --> 02:00:39,343
<i>The back door.</i>

1281
02:00:59,921 --> 02:01:01,236
Oh, no.

1282
02:01:02,916 --> 02:01:04,410
Here they come.

1283
02:01:33,098 --> 02:01:34,443
He's going to make it.

1284
02:01:44,668 --> 02:01:47,388
<i>The fire escape at the end of the alley, room 303.</i>

1285
02:02:23,009 --> 02:02:23,989
They're inside.

1286
02:02:26,353 --> 02:02:27,368
Hurry, Neo.

1287
02:03:23,639 --> 02:03:24,720
It can't be.

1288
02:03:32,532 --> 02:03:33,907
Check him.

1289
02:03:37,913 --> 02:03:39,455
He's gone.

1290
02:03:45,971 --> 02:03:48,579
Goodbye, Mr. Anderson.

1291
02:03:56,390 --> 02:03:57,266
Neo.

1292
02:03:58,484 --> 02:04:00,641
I'm not afraid anymore.

1293
02:04:02,190 --> 02:04:09,295
The Oracle told me that I'd fall in love with that the man.
The man that I love would be the One.

1294
02:04:12,223 --> 02:04:14,281
So you see...

1295
02:04:14,793 --> 02:04:16,986
you can't be dead.

1296
02:04:18,380 --> 02:04:20,407
You can't be...

1297
02:04:21,859 --> 02:04:24,118
because I love you.

1298
02:04:25,763 --> 02:04:27,671
You hear me?

1299
02:04:28,599 --> 02:04:30,459
I love you.

1300
02:04:54,210 --> 02:04:55,489
Now, get up.

1301
02:05:04,453 --> 02:05:05,333
No.

1302
02:05:32,124 --> 02:05:33,104
How?

1303
02:05:33,893 --> 02:05:35,024
He is the One.

1304
02:07:59,422 --> 02:08:00,930
<i>I know you're out there.</i>

1305
02:08:01,282 --> 02:08:03,308
<i>I can feel you now.</i>

1306
02:08:03,634 --> 02:08:05,326
<i>I know that you're afraid.</i>

1307
02:08:05,678 --> 02:08:07,356
<i>You're afraid of us.</i>

1308
02:08:07,597 --> 02:08:09,524
<i>You're afraid of change.</i>

1309
02:08:10,442 --> 02:08:12,236
<i>I don't know the future.</i>

<i>I didn't come here to tell you how this is going to end.</i>

1311
02:08:15,330 --> 02:08:18,284
<i>I came here to tell you how it's going to begin.</i>

1312
02:08:19,150 --> 02:08:20,728
<i>I am going to hang up this phone.</i>

1313
02:08:20,786 --> 02:08:24,170
<i>And then I am going to show these people
what you don't want them to see.</i>

1314
02:08:24,323 --> 02:08:26,297
<i>I'm going to show them a world...</i>

1315
02:08:26,350 --> 02:08:28,094
<i>without you.</i>

1316
02:08:28,394 --> 02:08:32,213
<i>A world without rules and controls,
without borders or boundaries.</i>

1317
02:08:32,273 --> 02:08:36,173
<i>A world where anything is possible.</i>

1318
02:08:38,713 --> 02:08:40,141
<i>Where we go from there...</i>

1319
02:08:40,298 --> 02:08:42,355
<i>is a choice I leave to you.</i>
